# Google Forms 

The [Google Forms AppSheet add-on](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/appsheet/hmmicpkfdjjchdajlldfckjaanfobjob?hl=en-US) works much the same way as
Google Sheets, with one exception. In order to interpret the Form data and
allow you to see responses, Google produces a 'response' Google Sheet for each
Form. _This_ spreadsheet is what AppSheet uses to generate a mobile app.Â This
is the easiest way to create apps if you're using Google Forms.

  1. Start with a Google Form where you've added a few form questions.
  2. From your Google Sheet, click Add-ons -> Get Add-ons -> then install AppSheet (it's free). Then click Add-ons again --> AppSheet.

  3. Click 'Prepare' in the add-on pane. After a few seconds, the 'Launch' button will be enabled. Click on 'Launch' -- AppSheet will automatically create a mobile app that has a similar mobile form.

  4. You are now taken to the app Editor on appsheet.com where you can customize your app.  
  
_Note: If you make changes to your form after already having created an app,
you need to go back through the Prepare and Launch steps in the add-on pane so
that AppSheet can recognize the changes.
