The first step to creating apps is choosing the cloud provider with which
you’ll connect to AppSheet. We support Google Drive, Box, Dropbox, Office365,
and Smartsheet.

There are two ways to get started. The easiest way is to use our [add-ons for
Google Apps](Create-an-app.md) if you're coming from
Google Forms or Google Sheets. Or, you can click “Sign in” at the top right of
the homepage. In both cases, click the appropriate cloud provider and sign
into AppSheet with that account’s details.

**Note:** AppSheet only uses your cloud provider’s authentication process, and
does not store any of your data on its servers. [You can find out more about
the sign-in process here.](Understanding-authentication-and-authorization.md)

Once you’re signed in, you’ll want to connect a spreadsheet that holds some 
data to AppSheet in order to begin creating your first app. There are a few 
ways to do this. If you’re using Google Apps, you can use AppSheet’s convenient 
[Google Sheets and Google Forms add-ons](Use-AppSheet-s-add-ons-for-Google-Apps.md). 
Otherwise, you can either make a new app or copy one of our samples.

In the next section we’ll walk you through how to [set up your spreadsheet to be AppSheet-friendly](How-to-build-the-spreadsheet.md).
