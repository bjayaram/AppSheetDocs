#  Data access for different classes of users


November 20, 2015 20:22

Many AppSheet apps allow users to update data. Please see [this article](/hc
/en-us/articles/205113918-Controlling-data-updates) that describes how you
control update permissions at the granularity of the entire app.

There is sometimes a desire to limit the ability of a certain class of users
to see and/or update some data. For example, the creator of an app for use in
the workplace may want work assignments editable by managers, but not by
employees.

You cannot limit some data in the app to some users and other data to other
users. The simple answer in AppSheet is to build different apps for different
classes of users.

It is easy to build multiple apps against the same underlying data, but with
different permissions for each class of users. You can do this via the update
permissions instructions found in [this article](/hc/en-us/articles/205113918
-Controlling-data-updates).
