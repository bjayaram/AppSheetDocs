#  App updates


October 26, 2015 23:50

As the creator/owner of an app, you can make changes to the app definition at
any time. These changes take effect immediately. For example, if you add a
change workflow rule to your app, it starts to work the moment you save the
change.

Most of your changes to the app definition involve changes in the actual
mobile app. These changes are automatically picked up by your users the next
time they Sync their app from their mobile device.

As described in the section on Sync, it is possible that an update to your app
definition can disrupt your app users. So you should be thoughtful in making
certain app updates. Here's the scenario. Your app user has one version of
your app and captures some new data. Before they Sync the data, you make a
change to the app definition (let's say you change some columns in the
spreadsheet and regenerate the app). Now when your user tries to Sync the
change, there is a mismatch and AppSheet shows the user an error message. The
only remedy is for the user to discard the changes (via the Reset Changes menu
option).
