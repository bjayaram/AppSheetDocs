#  Launching apps from AppSheet's mobile app gallery


December 07, 2015 19:18

We encourage you to install your apps' icons to your homescreen when you're
ready to deploy them. However, there are a handful of reasons you may want to
use apps without having to first install them to your phone.

All of the apps you create with AppSheet are available via AppSheet's mobile
app that you [downloaded from the app store](/hc/en-us/articles/213399798
-Deployment-from-an-install-link-new-). Likewise, AppSheet's app also features
a gallery of public sample apps and the apps that others have shared with you.
You may want to use these apps without having to install them. Here's how to
do it:

  1. Launch the AppSheet mobile app on your mobile device. It will ask you to log in. Do so with the same account you used for app creation.
  2. You can choose to view "My Apps", "Public", and "Shared". Choose a view, then click 'Sync' to download the most updated version of each app.
