#  Basic app customizations


January 05, 2016 21:49

The "editor" is the AppSheet web page that lets you customize the app you just
created.

Every new app creator starts with the **Basic Editor**\-- this lets you edit
simpler apps and shows only the most important app features. It prioritizes
simplicity and ease of use. There is also an Advanced Editor that exposes the
full functionality of the AppSheet model-- more about that later. For now,
let's focus on the Basic Editor.

  * There is a **fully interactive emulator** on the left that previews the mobile app.
  * The editor tool (app definition) is shown on the right. It has three main sections-- **Data, UX, and Settings**.

First, play with the app in the live emulator window.

  * Click on images and other content in the app-- the app reacts appropriately.
  * At the bottom of the app are the 'view controls'. These allow the user to switch between different data views.
  * The four buttons at the corners of the app are part of every app
    - The **Sync **button at bottom right synchronizes changes in the app with changes to the backend spreadsheet.
    - The **Share** button at bottom left lets the user send an app install link to others.
    - The **Search** button at top right allows the user to search the data in the current view.
    - The **Menu**Â (hamburger) button at top left provides advanced options and can be used for more views.

**Explore the Data section.**

  * You can see the spreadsheet data either as a preview or in a separate browser window.
  * Modify and save the data (rows) in the spreadsheet, and click on the Sync button in the app emulator to see these changes in the app.
  * You can decide whether the app allows the user to make data changes. Changing this option automatically refreshes the app in the emulator.
  * In the app emulator, make changes to the data and click the Sync button. The changes will be pushed back to your spreadsheet.
  * Modify the structure (columns) of the spreadsheet, and click on the 'Regenerate column structure' button to reflect these changes in your app.
  * To use a different spreadsheet instead, click on the 'Switch to another spreadsheet' link.

** **Explore the UX section.**

  * Some of the options here allow you to change the look and feel of the application. Try to change the app logo by selecting an image file from your cloud storage.
  * Other options let you control the view controls that appear at the bottom of your app.

** **Explore the Settings section.**

  * Name your app, indicate the industry, and the app's function.
  * Decide your app's level of security by choosing whether to require sign-in. If you require sign-in, you'll also get the opportunity to manage the user whitelist.
  * Choose whether you'd like to run your app offline.

In the next section, we'll walk you through how to use the Advanced Editor.
