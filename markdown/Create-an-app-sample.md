# 1\. Start with a sample 

You can always start by copying a sample app from our [template
gallery](https://www.appsheet.com/template/Gallery). Just open any app and
click “Copy” at the top. You’ll get the option to rename the app.

Here's what AppSheet actually does when you click the OK button:

  * Creates a folder for this app at [cloud provider]/AppSheet/data/[appName].
  * Copies the spreadsheet(s) used by the app into this folder.
  * Generates a mobile app automatically from the spreadsheet(s).

You now have full access to the spreadsheet that was used to create this app.
You can either replace it with your own data or switch to another spreadsheet.
**Note:** when you copy an app, you do not get a copy of the icons and logos--
you will need to add those later. _

Once you’ve clicked “Ok”, you’re now taken to AppSheet’s Editor tool where
you’ll customize your app. AppSheet has a Basic and Advanced Editor-- some
apps can use both, and others are too complex for the Basic Editor. We will
expand more on that later, but for now, we’ve landed in the Basic Editor.

From here, play around with the Basic Editor. You can preview the data in the
spreadsheet, navigate to the spreadsheet itself, or switch to a new
spreadsheet.

**Note:** if you switch to your own spreadsheet, you will need to click “Refresh column structure” so AppSheet expects the column structure of the new spreadsheet.
