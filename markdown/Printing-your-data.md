#  Printing your data


October 26, 2015 23:20

Many mobile apps replace paper-based processes, but you may still want to
print out the data collected by your app. You can do this in a number of
different ways depending on your specific needs:

  1. Using the spreadsheet 
    * Most spreadsheets have a variety of options to format and print data
    * If you are using Google Sheets, there are add-ons that allow you to format and print your data
  2. Using AppSheet 
    * You can use the change workflow rules to send emails when changes occur, along with printable attachments
    * If you run AppSheet in fullscreen mode in a browser, you can use the browser Print (Ctrl-P) functionality to print the contents of the current view
