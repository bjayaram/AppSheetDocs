# Smartsheet

[Smartsheet's integration with AppSheet](Integrating-with-Smartsheet.md) allows you to easily navigate from your
Smartsheet to AppSheet, but isn't a formal add-on and requires you to navigate
the "make a new app" process as described above in step 2.

You can either:

A. sign into AppSheet directly with your Smartsheet account, and then select
data from that account; or,

B. install AppSheet's integration from Smartsheet's App Gallery. Once you
install AppSheet (by logging into AppSheet with your Smartsheet account from
the browser popup), from there you can create apps directly from your
Smartsheets by clicking the Account menu at the top, then "Apps and
Integrations".
