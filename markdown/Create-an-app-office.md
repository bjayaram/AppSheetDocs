# Office 365 

[AppSheet's add-in for Office 365](Integrating-with-Excel-and-Office365.md) works much the same as the Google Forms, Google
Docs, and Google Sheets add-ons. If you're working from an Excel file, you can
add AppSheet's add-in from the Office 365 store.

1. From the "Insert" menu, click "Office Add-ins". To find AppSheet, search the store. 
  If you've already added AppSheet, just double click the AppSheet icon. The add-in pane 
  will appear to the right.Â

3. You are now taken to the app Editor on appsheet.com where you can customize your app.
