You can change the way information is displayed throughout your apps.

Go to the Advanced Editor>UX>Formatting:

**  
Text Color**

Text color and highlight color can be any 'hex' color code, for example this
is the color blue: #0F77FF

You can use this tool to find color codes:

In the [Assignment Manager sample app](https://www.appsheet.com/samples/An-app-to-manage-school-work-and-assignments?appGuidString=e32ee9da-990b-4056-929b-a66284c3e41c), we created four rules-- each one colors the assignment
name a different color based on the time left until it's due. You'll see we've
specified the color choices in the textColor field.  
  

**Text Size**

Text size can be a number or decimal between 0 and 3 where 3 means the text is
3 times larger than normal and 0.5 means text is half size.

** Map Pin Colors**

Additionally, adding a highlight color to a geographic type will change the
map pin color.  
**Icons**

You can choose to show an icon next to the row, inside the map pin, or on any
UX view.

Use the Advanced Editor>UX>Formatting tab to set icons based on rules for the
data in your app. Make sure to select any column where you would like the icon
featured (choose your location column to feature icons inside map pins instead
of numbers). You can use the icon dropdown menu to choose your icons. In our
[Equipment Inventory sample](https://www.appsheet.com/samples/A-convenient-app-for-company-employees-to-track-equipment-inventory?appGuidString=e0b57d92-3e6d-46f5-b441-cb784ac99c08), you'll see we've chosen to mark items with a
"thumbs-up" or "thumbs-down":
