# Google Sheets 

You can use [AppSheet's add-on for Google Sheets](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/appsheet/apemmfgpjhplakdihblplkjbakedfehh?hl=en-US) to turn your
Sheets into mobile apps. This is the easiest way to create apps if you're
using Google Sheets.

  1. It's best to start with a Google Sheet that already has some data. AppSheet works best when it has at least a couple of rows of well-structured data to work with.
  2. From your Google Sheet, click Add-ons -> Get Add-ons -> then install AppSheet (it's free). Then click Add-ons again --> AppSheet.
