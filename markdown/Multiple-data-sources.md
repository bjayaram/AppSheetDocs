#  Multiple data sources


January 22, 2016 20:59

Your AppSheet apps can access data from multiple data sources. The AppSheet
account always has a primary data source used for account authentication (for
many of our customers, this is Google Drive) and the spreadsheets from that
account can be used in your apps. However, you can add other data sources (eg:
Office 365, Smartsheet, Dropbox, Box, and more).

To add a new data source, go to your Account tab where you can examine your
current data sources and add or remove sources. Adding a source is as simple
as providing authentication.
