#  How do I control the order of rows displayed in my app?


January 16, 2016 00:18

For most of the presentation view types (except for Map and Chart), it is
possible to specify a sort order-- i.e. a column which tells AppSheet how to
order the data.

In the Basic Editor, the ordering column is picked via a dropdown associated
with each view. By default, the order is assumed to be Ascending (i.e. "AAA"
is shown before "ZZZ") but you could choose to sort Descending instead (i.e.
"ZZZ" is shown before "AAA"). To do this, simply scroll the dropdown to choose
the column name with a down arrow in front of it.

In the Advanced Editor, you achieve the same outcome by editing the view
properties.

The Table presentation view additionally provides richer options to [group the
data](How-do-I-control-the-order-of-columns-displayed-in-the-app-.md) as well by one or more columns.
