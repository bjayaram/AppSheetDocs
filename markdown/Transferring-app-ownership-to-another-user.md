#  Transferring app ownership to another user


November 14, 2015 00:19

You might want to transfer your ownership of any app to another user for a
variety of reasons. This means the new user will have full control of the
app's permissions and setup.

To transfer ownership to another user, use the Advanced
Editor>Settings>Security tab. You will need to specify the person's user
number and email address (both are shown on the Account page). By requiring
both pieces of information, we ensure that you must communicate with a user
before transferring the ownership of an app to him/her. Once you hit 'Save'
the new user will have full ownership.
