#  How do I convert from US Dollars to my local Currency?


January 28, 2016 18:04

Since [Column Type](Column-types.md) impacts how
AppSheet handles your data, selecting the appropriate column type is
important. AppSheet may not have recognized your data as currency either
because it doesn't yet recognize "Price" in your language or because you used
a spreadsheet column header such as "Tuition." You would like to change your
Column Type to "Price" and since AppSheet displays currency in US Dollars,
regardless of your selected Data Locale, you would like to select the correct
form of currency as well.



1\. To change your Column Type, select the Advanced Editor from the left
sidebar.
