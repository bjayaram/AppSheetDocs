You’ll see a window where you can name your new app and decide whether to use sample data or to select your own. Starting with sample data might be a good idea if you’re not sure how to structure your spreadsheet or if you’d like to see how data in a pre-existing spreadsheet shows in an app. If you choose to select your own, you will see a popup window which will allow you to choose the spreadsheet from your cloud provider. 
Either way, you always have the option in the app Editors to [switch to another spreadsheet](Using-the-app-editor-and-a-spreadsheet.md).
