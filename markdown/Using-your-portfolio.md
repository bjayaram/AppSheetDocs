#  Using your portfolio


November 13, 2015 19:51

You can choose to make your apps public and display them on your AppSheet
portfolio in order to share them with others. Your public apps will act as
samples and users who choose to view or copy them will not have write access
to your data nor will they be able to save edits with your app. They will
simply be able to clone your apps or view them for instructional purposes.

Please be aware that making your app public also means that the data within
the app is also visible to a public audience. Do NOT do this if you have
confidential data.

To make an app public, you'll need to use the Advanced
Editor>Settings>Security tab, and click the 'Sample App?' check box.

** **How to find your portfolio and edit its description**

Your portfolio can be found at the following link:
https://www.appsheet.com/portfolio/your user ID number

You can add a description, a photo, and even an external URL that navigates to
your personal website. When you're logged into AppSheet, click the Account tab
at the top, then Settings. There you'll be able to add the pertinent
information.
