#  Using multiple spreadsheets


January 16, 2016 00:24

Richer apps can use more than one table or spreadsheet data set.

In the Advanced Editor>Data>Tables tab, click on '+ Table' to choose another
spreadsheet. If you need to use a worksheet from the same workbook you are
already using in your app, simply define the sheet name (case included) in the
Worksheet Name/Qualifier field. The sheetÂ automatically gets added to your app
when you save your changes. You can now define control views over this data as
well.

 See a good example of multiple tables and cross-table references in the [Order Capture sample](https://www.appsheet.com/samples/An-app-for-a-salesperson-add-customers-orders-and-product-details?appGuidString=245700e5-9061-4045-843f-7850b5eb439a).
