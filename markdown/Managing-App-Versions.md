#  Managing App Versions


December 29, 2015 02:10

As you edit your app definition in the basic or advanced editor, AppSheet
maintains earlier versions of the app. This is useful if you need to recover
edits that you've overwritten. The Edit History is accessible from the Manage
pane in the app editors.

  
HOW DOES IT WORK?

Every time you save any information via the basic or the advanced editor,
AppSheet saves away the current version in an edit history log. Sometimes
these changes are explicit. Sometimes they are doing automatically by the
system (eg: when checking the consistency of your app).  
  

WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH AN OLDER VERSION?

You can open and view any older version. This opens the editor in a new
browser tab and displays that version of the app in read-only mode. The
emulator shows a preview as well. You can choose to "Restore" the app --- i.e.
make this version of the app the new latest version. The Restore action is
also available via the Manage pane in the app editor when you have opened the
specific app version.



WHAT CAN'T YOU DO WITH AN OLDER VERSION?

You cannot edit a specific version of the app
