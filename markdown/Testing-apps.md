#  Testing apps


January 23, 2016 01:35

During the app creation process, you may want to familiarize yourself with
AppSheet's app building platform and all of the features it offers. Our goal
is for you to be confident in the apps you create, the features they use, and
their intended functionality before you decide which pricing plan fits your
needs.

For these reasons, testing and prototyping apps are always free on AppSheet.
You will not be restricted from using certain features that may otherwise be
covered under paid plans if you are simply testing your apps and making sure
they are ready to launch and deploy. Once you are confident your app runs as
intended, and you know how many people will likely be using it, you can then
decide which pricing plan is right for you.

**How do I make sureÂ my app is ready to deploy?**

When you feel you're close to a working app, you will want to run a deploy
check. You can find out more about how to do this [here](/hc/en-
us/articles/205803947-Check-your-app-for-deployment).
