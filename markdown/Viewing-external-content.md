#  Viewing external content


January 13, 2016 22:46

Your app can also show URLs and documents.

We support two data types for external content-- **URL **and** File**. If you
have URLs in a column, the app allows users to click on the URL and see the
content in a hosted web browser window. Additionally, the users have the
option of opening the content in the native web browser on the device (eg:
Mobile Safari on iOS).

If you have PDFs or other documents, the app similarly opens the content in a
hosted web browser. Depending on the device and operating system, there may be
support for viewing of a variety of file types-- for example, most browsers
enable PDF viewing.

To include files or PDFs in your app, you will need to add either the file
name or the URL where the document is hosted. For example, in theÂ [Marketing
Docs sample](https://www.appsheet.com/samples/An-app-for-a-marketing-team-to-access-customer-case-studies-on-and-offline?appGuidString=2018fca7-8a19-49b9-a10b-7f53a05b7125), you'll see that the PDFs are coming from Google Drive
URLs. In order for these to be viewable by third parties, we made sure they
were publicly accessible by placing them in a public folder in Google Drive.
