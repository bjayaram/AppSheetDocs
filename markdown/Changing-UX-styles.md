January 14, 2016 01:08

There are different options to change the color theme and text fonts of the
app.

**Changing theme colors**

You can customize the theme and accent colors of your app in the UX tab of
both editors.

Next to 'Color theme' you'll see a dropdown list of colors. Single colors set
the theme of the app to that color only, and double colors change both the
theme color and the accent colors.

**Basic Editor**

** **Advanced Editor**

Go to theÂ Advanced Editor>UX>Branding tab.  
  
** **Changing fonts and font sizes**

Using the Advanced Editor>UX>Options tab, you can choose from a set of
available fonts and also modify the font size.
