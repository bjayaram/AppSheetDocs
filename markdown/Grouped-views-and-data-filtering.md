#  Grouped views and data filtering


January 13, 2016 21:43

AppSheet offers a number of ways to view your data. [References](References-between-tables.md) are great when you have data
across tables. Spreadsheets with hundreds of rows present a different problem.
Large data-sets need to be sorted and grouped to be useful.

In addition to adding group headers, AppSheet can also show a "drilldown" view
where data can be filtered to a single column value.
