#  Advanced app customizations


January 07, 2016 21:19

For richer apps or for more advanced app features, the Advanced Editor comes
in handy. You can get to it by clicking the Advanced Editor link at the top of
the Basic Editor.

The Advanced Editor keeps the three  **Data, UX, and Settings** sections-- each
one has at least three subsections.  
  

**Data**

The data section contains the three subsections **Tables, Column Structure, and Slices**. 
You can add [multiple spreadsheets](Using-multiple-spreadsheets.md) to your app, 
[adjust editing permissions](Controlling-data-updates.md), and more via the Tables
tab. The Column Structure tab allows you to 
[make changes to the structure of your spreadsheet data]
(Modifying-column-structure-in-the-editor.md). The Slices tab is where you 
specify [slices](Slices.md) (or filters) on your data.  

**UX**

** **Views, Branding, Formatting, and
Options**. Controls is where you can [choose the different views for your apps.](Choosing-and-adding-data-views.md) 
Branding
allows you to [add your own application icons and background screens.](Reflecting-your-brand.md) 
The Style tab enables you to
choose different customizations such as [font and color themes.](Changing-UX-styles.md) Last, Rules is where you specify
[change alerts/workflow rules.](Change-alerts-and-workflows.md)  


**Settings**

 
Settings contains the four subsections **Description, Security, Workflow, and
Content**. Description is where you can add various informational aspects to
your app. On the Security tab you can make [authentication changes to your
app.](Who-can-discover-and-install-your-app-) The
Content tab allows you to decide various miscellaneous aspects of your app,
like whether you want to be able to [launch offline or whether you'd like
saved changes to automatically sync to the backend spreadsheet](Offline-behavior)

**A few other things you can do with the Advanced Editor**

With the Advanced Editor, you can make much more specialized customizations to
your app.

  * You can add multiple spreadsheets (i.e. multiple tables) to your app. To see an example of this feature, look at the [Order Capture sample.](https://www.appsheet.com/Template/ShowDef?appName=OrderCapture-10305)
  * You can add multiple table slices to your app. To see an example of this feature, look at the [Marketing Event sample](https://www.appsheet.com/Template/ShowDef?appName=MarketingEvent-10305).
  * You can examine and modify the column structure of your data. To see an example of this feature, look at the [Consultant sample](https://www.appsheet.com/Template/ShowDef?appName=Consultant-10305).
  * You can define extra data views for your app. To see an example of this feature, look at the [Contact Directory sample](https://www.appsheet.com/Template/ShowDef?appName=ContactDirectory-10305).
  * You can modify various advanced settings.

Unlike the Basic Editor, the Advanced Editor does not automatically save
changes. You have to explicitly click the Save button.

In the next section, we'll show you how to [install and launch your apps](Step-1-Installing-the-AppSheet-mobile-app.md)
