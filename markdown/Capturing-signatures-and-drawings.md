#  Capturing signatures and drawings


January 28, 2016 08:07

Capturing signatures is easy with AppSheet. Simply insert a column in your
spreadsheet with the word "Signature" as the [column header](Effective-use-of-column-headers.md) where you would like
the signature pad to appear in the form. AppSheet will automatically detect
this new column as a Signature Type after you [regenerate column structure](Column-structure.md).

Alternatively, you can name the column anything you like and change the Column
Type to Signature manually in the Advanced Editor>Data>Column Structure tab.

The Drawing type is similar to Signature, but provides a larger canvas and
colored pens in order to capture free-form sketches within the app.
