#  Help content for the app user


November 12, 2015 01:20

Users of your app may need information about the app. Every AppSheet app has
an 'About' page that is accessed from the hamburger menu at the top left. In
some cases it may be helpful to set the About page as the app's initial launch
page.

The view has the following information that you can configure via the Basic
Editor:

  * The name of the app
  * The logo
  * The description

The view also shows more information that you can configure via the Advanced
Editor>Settings>Description tab:

  * The full description
  * User guidance
  * App version
  * About Url (the image gets linked to the url you provide)

For example, here's the About view for one of our sample apps:

## Related articles {.section}

  * [Conditional formatting](Conditional-formatting.md)
  * [Choosing and adding data views](Choosing-and-adding-data-views.md)
  * [Displaying images and documents](Displaying-images-and-documents.md)
  * [Data access for different classes of users](Data-access-for-different-classes-of-users.md)
  * [Expressions](Expressions.md)
