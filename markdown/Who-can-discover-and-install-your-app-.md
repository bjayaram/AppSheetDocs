#  Who can discover and install your app?


January 23, 2016 00:04

AppSheet does not have an app store or any other environment for others to
discover your apps. This is by design. You decide to tell others about your
app by sharing an install link. And your existing users can share the app
install link with others as well. Of course, if someone decides to post your
app's install link on Twitter, this could be a good thing or a bad thing for
you** **You can do this in the Basic Editor>Settings tab, and the
Advanced Editor>Settings>Security tab.**

Click the checkbox next to 'Require User Authentication'.
