# Who should use AppSheet and what kind of apps can it create? â€“ AppSheetOctober 26, 2015 22:50
AppSheet allows anyone to create elegant, powerful, and useful applications
for business, professional, or personal needs. If you are computer savvy and
use online tools to manage your life and work, AppSheet is meant for you, and
hundreds of millions of others like you. It generally takes complex
programming to build useful applications. However, AppSheet enables a limited
but important subset of apps-- those that follow a simple data-driven pattern.
The behavior of an AppSheet app is almost completely determined by the
structure of your data. That's why you can build an app without writing any
code. You can build apps for project management, field operations, customer
service, team collaboration, task management, staffing, and so much more.
AppSheet apps are designed to work offline-- you can control and enable
various aspects of online behavior. Check out some of our samples.
