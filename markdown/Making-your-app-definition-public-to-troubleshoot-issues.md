#  Making your app definition public to troubleshoot issues


November 20, 2015 20:21

Often, there is a need to show someone else your app's definition. Another
common use case is when you want someone else to see your app definition and
make suggestions for improvements (eg: when posting questions to the user
community). You can do this in two quick steps:

  1. Mark your app as a 'sample' to appear in your [AppSheet portfolio](/hc/en-us/articles/205176038). See information about this below.
  2. Copy a link to the app definition (from your browser url bar) and share it with whoever needs to help with the troubleshooting (usually, add it in a post on our user community forum).

Please be aware that making your app public also means that the data within
the app is also visible to a public audience. Do NOT do this if you have
confidential data.

In the Advanced Editor>Settings>Security tab,Â click the 'Sample App?' check
box. The app definition now becomes publicly visible via your portfolio page:
https://www.appsheet.com/portfolio/<userid>. Or you can simply share/email the
browser link to the app editor page.
