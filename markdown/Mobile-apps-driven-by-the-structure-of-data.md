#  Mobile apps 'driven' by the structure of data


January 05, 2016 22:45

A mobile app created by AppSheet is completely driven by the structure of the
data.

  * The app can show various pre-defined views of the data. As the app creator, you [specify and customize the views shown](Choosing-and-adding-data-views.md).
  * The individual data values are [presented based on their type](Column-types.md). For example, an address is automatically geocoded and shown on a map. A phone number can be dialed or texted when selected.
  * If the app permits data to be added or updated, it automatically generates an [input form based on the structure of the data](Customizing-input-forms.md). Based on the column type, the input mechanism is automatically chosen. For example, an image column automatically launches a camera.

So in short, the app creator defines the structure of data and configures the
presentation of the data, but all of the detailed behaviors of the app are
automatically driven by the data.
