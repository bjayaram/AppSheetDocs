#  "Un-deploying" your app


October 26, 2015 23:50

If you want to permanently remove an app, you can simply delete it. The next
time any existing users sync the app, it will no longer run.

If you just want to remove specific users from an app that requires user sign
in, then removing them from the app whitelist suffices. The next time they
sync, the app will prompt them for signin and that will fail.
