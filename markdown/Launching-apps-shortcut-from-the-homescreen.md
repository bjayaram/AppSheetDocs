#  Launching apps shortcut from the homescreen


November 14, 2015 00:12

What happens when the user clicks on an app shortcut to launch the app?

Remember that your app is actually hosted on the [AppSheet mobile runtime](/hc
/en-us/articles/205111288-Traditional-vs-instant-app-deployment). So when the
user launches your app, it first loads AppSheet (which you do not see) and
then starts your app. The whole process only takes a few seconds, after which
the user can startÂ using your app. Your app looks and behaves exactly as it
did in the emulator on our website.
