#  Sharing and distributing your app


January 23, 2016 03:23

You distribute apps by sharing an installation link. Users who have not yet
downloaded AppSheet's mobile app from the app store [will be prompted to do so
before they can install apps created with AppSheet onto their devices](/hc/en-
us/articles/213399798-Deployment-from-an-install-link-new-).

There are a few ways to distribute apps.



**Sharing apps via the Editor**

When you're ready to launch your app, click the 'Share' button at the left of
either Editor.

** **Other ways to distribute apps**

Upon creation of an app, you (the creator) immediately receive an email with
the installation link. You can also distribute your apps via this email, in a
variety of ways:

  * You could forward that email to other users.
  * You could copy the link onto a website to share.
  * You could post it to Twitter and ask your followers to install the app.
  * You could send the link via an SMS message.

You get the idea** **Homescreen shortcut installation on Android**

On Android devices, you or your users can install app shortcuts from
AppSheet's app gallery without needing to use the installation link. If you
have downloaded the AppSheet app from the app store, and then open the [app
gallery](Launching-apps-from-AppSheet-s-mobile-
app-gallery), click into the app you want on your homescreen. You will be able
to install apps from there to your homescreen in just one step.

Simply click the hamburger menu at the top left and then click "Add Shortcut".
The current app's icon should then appear on the homescreen.

If you'd like your users to use this method, just make sure you've [shared the
app](Sharing-and-distributing-your-app) with
them. They will see your app in the "Shared" tab and can follow the above
instructions.
