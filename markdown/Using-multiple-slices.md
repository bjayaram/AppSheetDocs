#  Using multiple slices


January 22, 2016 20:57

Richer apps can use more than one table slice.

In the Advanced Editor>Data>Slices tab, click on 'New Slice' to add another
data slice. It automatically gets added to your app when you save your
changes. You can now define control views over this slice as well.
