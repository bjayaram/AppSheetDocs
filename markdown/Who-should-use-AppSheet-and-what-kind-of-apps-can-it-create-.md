October 26, 2015 22:50

AppSheet allows anyone to create elegant, powerful, and useful applications
for business, professional, or personal needs.

If you are computer savvy and use online tools to manage your life and work,
AppSheet is meant for you, and hundreds of millions of others like you.

It generally takes complex programming to build useful applications. However,
AppSheet enables a limited but important subset of apps-- those that follow a
simple data-driven pattern. The behavior of an AppSheet app is almost
completely determined by the structure of your data. That's why you can build
an app without writing any code.

You can build apps for project management, field operations, customer service,
team collaboration, task management, staffing, and so much more.

AppSheet apps are designed to work offline-- you can control and enable
various aspects of online behavior.
