App security matters because your data is exposed through your app. While we
follow sound technical practices like encrypting all network communication,
you have three simple and understandable mechanisms to control the security of
your app.

  * Distribution control-- AppSheet is not an app store. We do not let others search for your app or find it in any way. You distribute your app to the users that you choose.
  * Access control-- you can require the users of your app to sign in, and can specify a whitelist of users who have permissions to access the app. If you do this, nobody else can access the app.
  * Data control-- you can control the subset of data that is visible in the app, and control whether and how it can be updated. Even for the users who can access your app, this limits what they can see and do.
