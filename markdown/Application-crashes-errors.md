If you are seeing application crashes there are a couple of steps you can try
to resolve these issues:

  1. Close High memory applications - application crashes on a mobile device are usually due to high memory usage, and closing background applications can help free memory.  For Android devices there are some step by step instructions at:

and for iOS at:  
<https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330>

  2. Reboot the device - rebooting can also free system memory, and may resolve the issue.
  3. Reinstall the appsheet app - fully remove the appsheet app and reinstall it from your app store (Google Play or the Apple App Store).  Note that this will delete any local data, so don't do this if you have data changes on your device that still need to be synchronized to your spreadsheet.
  4. Update your OS - there may be an operating system update that resolves the issue.  For Android devices you'll need to check with your device manufacturer (Samsung, LG, HTC etc.).  For iOS there are instructions at:  
<https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204204>

If the steps above haven't resolved your issue please contact us at
support@appsheet.com.  When you contact support please let us know which
device you are using and what OS version you're running.  For example "Samsung
Galaxy S6 running 5.1.1" or "iPhone 6 Plus running iOS 8.3".

It will also help us to know if the crash reproduces in a web browser on your
device. To test this open Chrome on your Android device or Mobile Safari on
iOS.  From the browser on your device login to
[appsheet.com](https://www.appsheet.com) and in the "My Apps" section of the
website click "Preview" for your app then "Fullscreen".  This should start
your app in your mobile browser.  Use your app as you normally would and let
us know if you see the problem while running in the browser as well.
