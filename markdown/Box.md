#  Box

Box.com users tend to have corporate accounts and see a greater incidence of
two specific kinds of errors. One error occurs when copying a sample app or
making a new app. By default, AppSheet creates a folder for each app under the
/appsheet/data path, so that the sample spreadsheet and data can be copied
into it. In many corporate Box installations, users do not have permissions to
create a folder in this path. Instead, each user (say 'joe') has permissions
to a path that may be '/users/joe'. So you will need to change the default
folder path for your AppSheet account appropriately by accessing the 'Account'
tab on the top bar of our website. The other error reported by some of our Box
users is that Excel spreadsheet files seem to be automatically converted into
CSV files on some Box installations. Users can check this by just trying to
download the Excel file from Box to see if its format has been modified -- if
so, please consult with your Box admin.
