#  Reflecting your brand


February 15, 2016 20:24

There are different options to reflect the brand of your business in your app.
These options are found on the UX tab of both the Basic and Advanced Editors.  
  
To add branding images, click into the corresponding image fields in either
Editor. AppSheet will produce a popup that will allow you to pick images from
your cloud provider. It's a good idea to keep your images in the same folder
your app's spreadsheet is housed.

  1. **Icon**\-- this is the icon that your users will click to launch your app from the device's home screen. We encourage you to provide an icon that reflects your business or brand. This icon should be square and up to 196X196 in size (we automatically resize it for different environments).  
  
** **Launch image**\-- this is image that shows while the application is initially launched, and when Sync is in progress. It should be at least as wide as 600 pixels.  
  
** **Background image**\-- this image forms a semi-opaque backdrop for all pages in the app.It should be at least as wide as 600 pixels. Try different background images to find one that is aesthetically pleasing given the actual data in your app. We have found that if your data already contains images, a background image can be distracting.  
  
** **Color theme**\-- the color theme represents the color palette used in the app. We support both light and dark color themes, with the option to add more colors to the header, footer, text, and icons in your app.
