# Google Docs

The Google Docs AppSheet add-on is the fastest way to turn your paper-based
forms into mobile apps because you can instantly create an app using a Google
Doc that contains placeholders.

The add-on will let you build a Google Doc template with input placeholders
that you can update via a mobile app. Additionally, every time a response is
submitted, you get a copy of the completed template via Email and as a PDF.

  1. Create a document with placeholders for input fields. Any word that has << >> around it is an input placeholder. AppSheet will turn those placeholders into columns of a response sheet and create a mobile app where you can insert the values for the placeholder, which will then be sent to you via email and as a PDF.
  2. Launch the AppSheet add-on from the add-ons menu. 
  3. Click "Prepare" an then "Launch" from within the AppSheet sidebar. 
  4. You are now taken to the app Editor on appsheet.com where you can customize your app.
