#  How do I change a Column Type?


January 28, 2016 02:05

Since [Column Type](Column-types.md) impacts how
AppSheet handles your data, selecting the appropriate column type is
important. You designed your spreadsheet to be ["AppSheet-friendly"](Making-an-AppSheet-friendly-spreadsheet.md), but you
would prefer to change one of your column types, perhaps from Text to Name.



1\. To change your Column Type, select the **Advanced Editor** from the left
sidebar.

** **Data** > **Column Structure** and select **Show** for the
table you would like to change.

** **Column Type** that you
would like to change. In this example, for the Column Name "School", Column
Type was changed from "Text" to "Name."

** **Save** and your Column Type change is complete.
