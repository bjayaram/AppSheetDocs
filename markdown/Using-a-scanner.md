#  Using a scanner


January 13, 2016 22:40

AppSheet can use the camera on your phone or tablet to capture barcoded or qr-
coded data.

When you have marked an input column as scannable, your AppSheet application
displays a scan icon next to that input field. When you click this icon,
AppSheet activates the camera on your device and automatically reads the
barcode or qr-code. AppSheet then saves this scanned value in the input field.
AppSheet will recognize the column type you've chosen for that field (i.e.
URL, number, decimal, and so on) and populate the data in the correct
format.When you save your changes, the scanned value is saved along with any
other values you may have entered.

Use the Advanced Editor>Data>Column Structure to choose the column or columns
that you'd like to be scannable.
