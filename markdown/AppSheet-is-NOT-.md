#  AppSheet is NOT...

AppSheet is not an app discovery mechanism. It is not a place where your users
can "discover" the apps that you create. That is the traditional role of an
app store.

Instead, we leave it to you to distribute the apps to your users. Most of our
app creators are building apps for their colleagues, their employees, or their
existing customers. In those casesÂ there is already an obvious mechanism to
distribute the app to the desired users. Because all you need is an
installation link, it becomes trivial to distribute this link via email or any
other communication mechanism.

AppSheet is also not an app marketplace. It is not a place where users buy
apps or app creators sell apps. Again, that would be the role of an app store,
but that is not the role of AppSheet. We are not involved in any commerce
related to the apps themselves. Instead, we are providing a platform service
for users to create, deploy, and run apps.
