#  Check your app for deployment


January 23, 2016 01:31

There are a few simple checks to make sure your app is ready for use and
deployment.

On the app editor page, click the **Manage** buttonÂ and run a Deployment
check. AppSheet verifies that your app is ready to deploy-- if not, it informs
you about steps you need to take.

** One class of checks is associated with the app definition and the underlying data. Any errors or warnings will be highlighted.
  * An app must be assigned a launch icon and description before deployment.
  * Because app security is really important, the deployment check includes a security review.
  * Finally, AppSheet ensures that the features used by the app are compatible with your account type.
