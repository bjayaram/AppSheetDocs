  <h1>Conditional formatting – AppSheet</h1>
  <div class="content-body article-body">
    <p>You can change the way information is displayed
    throughout your apps.</p>
    <p>Go to the Advanced Editor>UX>Formatting:</p>
    <p><img src=
    "/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204883168/Screen_Shot_2016-01-14_at_6.08.13_PM.png"
    alt=""/></p>
    <p>
    When you create a new rule, the first thing you need to choose
    is which table the rule applies to in the "For this
    data" dropdown. 
    </p>
    <p><img src=
    "/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204883278/Screen_Shot_2016-01-14_at_6.11.58_PM.png"
    alt=""/></p>
    <p>
    Then specify a condition that must be satisfied for the
    formatting rule to take effect. If you leave this blank, the
    rule applies to all rows in the table. However, you could
    specify a simple formula like [Country] = "USA" or a more
    complex formula for richer behaviors. </p>
    <p>Next, choose the columns that you want formatted. You can
    hold the 'Ctrl' key to select multiple columns. 
    </p>
    <p><img src=
    "/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204909437/Screen_Shot_2016-01-14_at_6.11.58_PM.png"
    alt=""/></p>
    <p> 
    Finally, specify some formatting settings. You will see a list
    of things you can customize.</p>
    <p><strong>
    Text Color</strong></p>
    <p>Text color and highlight color can be any 'hex' color code,
    for example this is the color blue: #0F77FF </p>
    <p>You can use this tool to find color codes: <a href=
    "http://www.colorpicker.com/.html" target="_blank" rel=
    "noreferrer">http://www.colorpicker.com</a></p>
    <p>In the <a href=
    "https://www.appsheet.com/samples/An-app-to-manage-school-work-and-assignments?appGuidString=e32ee9da-990b-4056-929b-a66284c3e41c.html">
    Assignment Manager sample app</a>, we created
    four rules-- each one colors the assignment name a
    different color based on the time left until it's due. You'll
    see we've specified the color choices in the textColor
    field.
    </p>

    alt=""/></p>
    <p><strong>Text Size</strong></p>
    <p>Text size can be a number or decimal between 0 and 3 where 3
    means the text is 3 times larger than normal and 0.5 means text
    is half size.</p>
    <p><strong>
    Map Pin Colors</strong></p>
    <p>Additionally, adding a highlight color to a
    geographic type will change the map pin color.

    alt=""/></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><strong>Icons</strong></p>
    <p>You can choose to show an icon next to the
    row, inside the map pin, or on any UX view.</p>
    <p>Use the Advanced Editor>UX>Formatting tab to set icons
    based on rules for the data in your app. Make sure to select
    any column where you would like the icon featured (choose
    your location column to feature icons inside map pins
    instead of numbers). You can use the icon dropdown menu to
    choose your icons. In our <a href=
    "https://www.appsheet.com/samples/A-convenient-app-for-company-employees-to-track-equipment-inventory?appGuidString=e0b57d92-3e6d-46f5-b441-cb784ac99c08.html">
    Equipment Inventory sample</a>, you'll see we've chosen to mark
    items with a "thumbs-up" or "thumbs-down":
