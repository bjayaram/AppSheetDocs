  <h1>Change alerts and workflows â€“ AppSheet</h1>
  <div class="content-body article-body">
    <p>You might want to take actions when data updates occur.
    Change workflows are the mechanism to do this. Change workflow
    rules (emails) fire at the AppSheet backend when data changes
    aremade and synced throughthe AppSheet app
    running onthe mobile device or the desktop browser.</p>
    <p>Every change workflow rule is structured as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>When does the rule fire?
        <ul>
          <li>On specific actions: you can choose Adds, Deletes,
          Updates or any combination of them.</li>
          <li>On specific tables or slices: if you have an app with
          multiple tables or slices, you can choose a subset of
          these to trigger the workflow rule.</li>
          <li>Only <em>after</em>the modification has been
          saved to the spreadsheet, so any formulas in the
          spreadsheet will be computed on the row before the update
          email is sent.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>What action should be performed?
        <ul>
          <li>At the moment, the only action supported is to send
          an email. You can customize many aspects of that email as
          we'll describe below.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>This feature setwill grow further in functionality
    over time. The rules can be authored in the Advanced
    Editor>Settings>Content. Please notethat
    whilethe app is in test mode (i.e. it has not passed a
    <a href=
    "205803947-Check-your-app-for-deployment.html">Deployment
    Check</a>), any messages sent from workflow actions will go
    only to the app creator.</p>
    <p>Let's look closer at each of the components of a workflow
    rule.
    </p>
    <p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Controlling
    when a workflowrule fires</span><span class=
    "wysiwyg-underline"></span></strong>A workflow rule can be
    triggered when:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Anew row isadded to a table.</li>
      <li>Arow is updated in a table.</li>
      <li>Arow is deleted from a table.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may wish to further restrict when a workflowrule
    is triggered. For example, maybe the workflow rule should only
    be triggeredwhena row ischangedand
    therowsatisfies a specific condition. For
    example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When a new row is added to the Inspections table, and the
      value in the InspectionPassed field is false.</li>
      <li>When a row is updated in the Orders slice, and the value
      in the OrderAmount field is over $500.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We enable thisvia slices. Typically, you define
    slices in order to show filtered views of the data. This is a
    very different use of slices. You can choose to trigger a rule
    only if the changed row is includedin a slice. So in the
    first example above, you would define a slice that includes
    only rows wherethe InspectionPassed field is false. You
    would thenconfigureyour workflow rule to refer
    tothis slice and only take effect when a row
    isadded.</p>
    <p>Note that since you can specify multiple change actions and
    multiple tables or slices in each rule, it is a very powerful
    mechanism to specify the rule firing condition.
    </p>
    <p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">When
    areworkflowrules invoked?</span></strong>The
    AppSheet workflow rules are evaluated on the AppSheet server
    when a user does an add, update, or delete through the AppSheet
    client and then syncs these changes back to the server. When
    the client syncs the changes to the server, the server first
    makes the appropriate changes to the spreadsheet and then
    checks whether any workflow rules should be invoked.</p>
    <p>The AppSheet server invokes theworkflow rule
    actionifall of the following conditions are
    satisfied.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>It first checks whether any workflow rules have been
      specified for the updated table or slice.</li>
      <li>If workflow rules are specified for the table or slice,
      the server checks whether the workflow rule's "Update event"
      type matches the action the user performed, that is Add,
      Update, or Delete.</li>
      <li>Finally, if the workflow rule is specified for a Slice,
      the server checks whether the slice filter condition is true.
      The serverskips this step, if the workflow rule is
      associated with a table rather than a slice.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Changes you make directly to the spreadsheetdo not go
    through the AppSheet server, so they do not trigger the
    AppSheet workflow rules. For example, if you update a Google
    Sheet directly, Google Sheets does not notify the AppSheet
    server about the change, so the AppSheet server is completely
    unaware of the change. When your AppSheet client performs a
    sync, the AppSheet server will read the Google Sheet and return
    the updated data values to the client, but AppSheet server is
    unaware that you updated the Google Sheet directly.
    </p>
    <p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">What action is
    performed?</span><span class=
    "wysiwyg-underline"></span></strong>At the moment, the only
    action supported is sending email. You can configure the
    following aspects of the email:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Send to:</strong>This is a comma-separated
      list of email addresses or expressions that yield email
      addresses.</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>You can enterspecific email addresses, such as
      <strong>JohnHughes@gmail.com</strong>. If you enter an email
      address that contains special characters such as hyphen or
      plus, you must enclose the email address in quotes, such as
      "<strong>John-L-Hughes@gmail.com".</strong></li>
      <li>You can specify that the email address be taken from a
      field in the record that is being updated. For example, when
      a new order is captured, you may wish to send email to the
      customer who created the order. You can do thisby
      entering anexpression specifyingthe
      fieldnamecontaining the customer's email
      address. For example, if there isa field called
      "CustomerEmail" in the updated record, you can
      specify<strong>[CustomerEmail]</strong>in the
      email address list.</li>
      <li>You can specify that the email address be taken from a
      field in a record that is referenced bythe record
      being updated.For example, each of yourOrder
      records mightcontain a reference to a Customer record.
      EachCustomer record might contain the customer's email
      address. When a new order is captured, you cansend
      email to the customer who created the order. You can do
      thisby entering the name of the Order record field
      thatreferences the customer record, followed by the
      name of the Customer record field containing the customer's
      email address. For example, assumethe name of the
      Order record field thatreferences the customer record
      is <strong>CustRef</strong>, Assume the name of the Customer
      record field containing the customer's email
      addressis<strong>CustEmail</strong>. You
      canspecify the customer's email address
      byentering the expression
      <strong>[CustRef].[CustEmail]</strong> in theemail
      address list.</li>
      <li>You can specify that the email addresses be taken from an
      entire column in another table. For example, you could create
      a table called <strong>PeopleToInform</strong>having
      two columns, <strong>Name</strong> and
      <strong>EmailAddress</strong>. Each timea new order is
      captured, you cansend email toall of the people
      in the<strong>PeopleToInform</strong>table. Do
      this byentering the expression
      <strong>PeopleToInform</strong><strong>[EmailAddress]</strong>
      in theemail address list.</li>
      <li>When you specify multiple email addresses, you can
      include any combinationof specific email addresses and
      expressions in the email address list. For example, you could
      specify the following email address
      list.<strong>JohnHughes@gmail.com,"</strong>John-L-Hughes@gmail.com",[CustomerEmail],[CustRef].[CustEmail],PeopleToInform<strong>[EmailAddress]</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Email Subject:</strong>AppSheet uses a
      default subject, but you can override that with your own
      subject text. Here, you can define placeholders that are
      filled in by the values in the updated entry. Here is an
      example of a subject line: 'Thanks
      <<CustomerName>> for your order!'</li>
      <li><strong>Emailbody:</strong> You have three options
      when it comes to the body of the email. You can customize the
      email body field or add a body template (as described below),
      or simply do nothing and receive a default email that
      contains <strong>all</strong> of the values for the updated
      row. Here's what it looks like if you do not choose to
      customize the email body or provide a body template:
      
      <img src=
      "/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202926318/Screen_Shot_2015-08-28_at_5.08.47_PM.png"
      alt="" width="517" height="338">
      </li>
      <li><strong>Email body:</strong>May contain template
      variables. Use this field when you have a simple email
      body.</li>
      <li><strong>Body template:</strong>For more complex
      workflow emails, you can specify a Google doc that may
      contain text, images, and placeholders (see next section
      about placeholders). After the placeholders are replaced the
      resulting document becomes the email body. Use this field
      when you have a more complex email body. When a Body template
      is present, it is used in lieu of the â€œEmail bodyâ€.</li>
      <li><strong>Attachment template:</strong>You can
      optionally specify a template file to use as an email
      attachment. The file itself is chosen from your cloud file
      system (at the moment, we only support Google Drive for this
      feature and the template file is a Google Doc). In your
      document, or in the subject line, for example, you may want
      toinclude placeholders that correspond to your column
      headers, and that will be replaced when actual data updates
      are madei.e."<<CustomerName>> has
      been added to your app". When an email is actually sent, it
      will carry a PDF attachment that is a copy of this file with
      the placeholders replaced by actual values from the updated
      entry.</li>
      <li><strong>Attachment Name:</strong>The name given to
      the email attachment. The default AttachmentName is
      â€œChangeReportâ€. You may specify a different name and may
      include placeholders in the AttachmentName.</li>
      <li><strong>CC:</strong>Email "CC value. May contain
      one or more email addresses. Multiple addresses must be
      separated by commas. You can enter bothspecific email
      addresses andexpressions as described with "Send
      to".</li>
      <li><strong>BCC:</strong>Email "BCC" value. May
      contain one or more email addresses. Multiple addresses must
      be separated by commas.You can enter
      bothspecific email addresses andexpressions as
      described with "Send to".</li>
      <li><strong>Reply to:</strong>Email "reply to" value.
      May contain one email address.You can enter either
      aspecific email address or an expression as described
      with "Send to".</li>
      <li><strong><span style=
      "font-weight: 400;"><strong>PreHeader:</strong></span></strong>The
      default PreHeader valueis
      "'<<_UPDATEMODE>> to application
      '<<_APPNAME>>' table '<<_TABLENAME>>'
      by '<<_USERNAME>>' at '<<_NOW>>'".
      This would yield a PreHeader such as "Update to application
      'Workflow' by 'Julie Morgan' at 8/26/2015 6:12:28 PM". You
      may customize the PreHeader and may include placeholders.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Over time, we intend to provide a richer set of actions
    including the ability to post to external systems, to utilize
    other communication channels, andto make other data
    updates. In particular, this could trigger a chainof
    workflow rules leading to rich, multi-step behaviors.
    <strong>
    <span class=
    "wysiwyg-font-size-large">Placeholders</span></strong>You
    can specify a variety of placeholders in your email subject,
    body, PreHeader, attachment name, and templates that will
    populate with the correct corresponding data when the email is
    fired. Here's a list of AppSheet's built-in placeholders-- note
    that each one carries a preceding mandatory
    underscore.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <strong><<_APPID>>:</strong>Application
      GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) that identifies the
      AppTemplate e.g.
      â€œ8c26466f-1db0-4032-9c0f-40c2a588cf50â€.</li>
      <li><strong><<_APPNAME>>:</strong>The name
      of the AppSheet application e.g. â€œWorkflow-10301â€.</li>
      <li><strong><<_APPOWNER>>:</strong>The
      Owner Id of the AppSheet application e.g. â€œ10301â€.</li>
      <li>
      <strong><<_ATTACHMENTNAME>>:</strong>The
      name given to the attachment.</li>
      <li><strong><<_NOW>>:</strong>The current
      date and time e.g. "6/15/2009 1:45:30 PM".</li>
      <li><strong><<_ROWKEY>>:</strong>The key
      value of the added, deleted, or updated record.</li>
      <li><strong><<_ROW_WEB_LINK>>:</strong>URL
      that opens the added or updated record in AppSheet. The
      record key is displayed as the link name.</li>
      <li><strong><<_ROW_WEB_URL>>:</strong>URL
      that opens the added or updated record in AppSheet. The full
      URL is displayed. Customers will probably use
      <<_ROW_WEB_LINK>> more commonly.</li>
      <li><strong><<_RULENAME>>:</strong>Name of
      the workflow rule e.g. â€œMy Update Ruleâ€.</li>
      <li><strong><<_TABLENAME>>:</strong>Name
      of the table e.g. â€œOrdersâ€.</li>
      <li><strong><<_TIMENOW>>:</strong>The
      current time e.g. "1:45:30 PM"</li>
      <li><strong><<_TODAY>>:</strong>The
      current date e.g. "6/15/2009".</li>
      <li><strong><<_UPDATEMODE>>:</strong>The
      name of the operation that triggerred the workflow rule.
      Namely, â€œAddâ€, â€œDeleteâ€ or â€œUpdateâ€.</li>
      <li><strong><<_USEREMAIL>>:</strong>The
      current userâ€™s email address e.g.
      â€œjmorgan@google.comâ€.</li>
      <li><strong><<_USERNAME>>:</strong>The
      current userâ€™s name e.g. â€œJulie Morganâ€.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We also allow you to use placeholders that correspond to
    your column headers.The placeholders must
    exactlycorrespond to the column names in your
    spreadsheet, case included, with the following format:
    <<ColumnName>>. Do not include underscores as with
    AppSheet's built-in placeholders.</p>
    <p>You can also use any <a href=
    "/hc/en-us/sections/203786738-Expressions.html">AppSheet
    expression</a>in a placeholder. This allows you to
    customize your templates with powerful data-driven logic.</p>
