  <h1>Keys – AppSheet</h1>
  <div class="content-body article-body">
    <p>A 'key' <strong>uniquely</strong> identifies each
    individual row in the table.</p>
    <p>The key may be a single column (such as Employee ID) or a
    composite column (such as FirstName and LastName).</p>
    <p>When end-users change data on a mobile device, they are not
    actually interacting with the spreadsheet at that moment. They
    make the change to a local copy of the data and AppSheet needs
    to make sure the change can be applied to the spreadsheet
    sometime later (when the device is online and the user syncs
    the changes).</p>
    <p>Without a key to uniquely identify the row changes,
    AppSheet would find it impossible to apply the change to the
    appropriate spreadsheet row.</p>
