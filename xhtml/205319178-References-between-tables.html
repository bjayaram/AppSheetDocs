  <h1>References between tables – AppSheet</h1>
  <div class="content-body article-body">
    <p>Once you have an app with <a href=
    "205098468-Using-multiple-spreadsheets.html">multiple
    spreadsheets</a> it's useful to create connections or
    "References" between the sheets and slices.</p>
    <p>Columns with a Ref column type always point to the
    <strong><em>Key</em></strong> field in the table they are
    referencing. If you need other columns besides the
    reference key field, consider using a De-reference
    (See <a href="211326838-Expressions.html" target=
    "_blank">Expressions</a>).</p>
    <p>A reference example, the <a href=
    "https://www.appsheet.com/samples/An-app-for-a-salesperson-add-customers-orders-and-product-details?appGuidString=245700e5-9061-4045-843f-7850b5eb439a.html">
    Order Capture sample app</a> has a spreadsheet of products in
    inventory and a separate spreadsheet of orders. The products
    spreadsheet is kept up to date with all the products in the
    warehouse and when someone buys a product a new row is added to
    the orders spreadsheet.</p>
    <p>The problem is when a new order is created, the product
    information from the products spreadsheet has to be manually
    copied into the orders spreadsheet.</p>
    <p>This is a great place to use References. Since each row in
    the orders spreadsheet has one product, we can add a column
    with the product id to the orders spreadsheet. This connection
    between the spreadsheets will be used a in few different areas
    of AppSheet to make your app much more convenient and
    powerful.</p>

    references</span></strong></p>
    <p><span class=
    "wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-font-size-medium">AppSheet
    will automatically create references between tables if there is
    a column name that contains the name of another table in your
    app, followed by the name of a column in that table. For
    example if you have a Customers table that has a Name column,
    another sheet that has a column named Customer Name will
    automatically be a Reference when the row is added.</span></p>
    <p><span class=
    "wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-font-size-medium">Otherwise,
    you can create and modify references manually using the
    Advanced Editor by setting the Field Type of a column to Ref
    and putting the name of the spreadsheet to reference in the
    ReferencedType field.
