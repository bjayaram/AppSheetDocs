  <h1>Transferring app ownership to another user – AppSheet</h1>
  <div class="content-body article-body">
    <p>You might want to transfer your ownership of any app
    to another user for a variety of reasons. This means the new
    user will have full control of the app's permissions and
    setup.</p>
    <p>To transfer ownership to another user, use the Advanced
    Editor>Settings>Security tab. You will need to specify
    the person's user number and email address (both are shown on
    the Account page). By requiring both pieces of
    information, we ensure that you must communicate with a user
    before transferring the ownership of an app to him/her. Once
    you hit 'Save' the new user will have full ownership.</p>

    <p>It is very important that the new user also have access to
    the files (sheets, images, PDFs, etc) and folders used by the
    app. Otherwise the app will stop working the moment ownership
    is transferred. If you are working with Google Sheets and are
    transferring to user B, make sure to share the sheet(s) with
    user B. It is also important that user B accepts the shared
    sheet via "Add to my Drive".</p>
