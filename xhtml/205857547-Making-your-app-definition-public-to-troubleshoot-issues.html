  <h1>Making your app definition public to troubleshoot issues –
  AppSheet</h1>
  <div class="content-body article-body">
    <p>Often, there is a need to show someone else your app's
    definition. Another common use case is when you want someone
    else to see your app definition and make suggestions for
    improvements (eg: when posting questions to the user
    community). You can do this in two quick steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Mark your app as a 'sample' to appear in your <a style=
      "background-color: #ffffff;" href="205176038.html">AppSheet
      portfolio</a>. See information about this below.
      </li>
      <li>Copy a link to the app definition (from your browser url
      bar) and share it with whoever needs to help with the
      troubleshooting (usually, add it in a post on our user
      community forum).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Please be aware that making your app public also means that
    the data within the app is also visible to a public audience.
    Do NOT do this if you have confidential data.</p>
    <p>In the Advanced Editor>Settings>Security
    tab, click the 'Sample App?' check box. The app
    definition now becomes publicly visible via your portfolio
    page: https://www.appsheet.com/portfolio/&lt;userid&gt;. Or you
    can simply share/email the browser link to the app editor
    page.</p>
