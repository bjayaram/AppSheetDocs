  <h1>Content caching on the AppSheet server – AppSheet</h1>
  <div class="content-body article-body">
    <p>You can modify the way AppSheet caches content on both
    server and mobile device.</p>
    <p>By default, AppSheet does not cache spreadsheet data on the
    server. However, server-side data caching can significantly
    improve the speed perceived by app users during a Sync.
    Explained in simple terms, the mobile app can get the data
    directly from AppSheet's servers without having to wait for the
    data to be fetched from the backend cloud storage platform
    (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc). </p>
    <p>You can explicitly enable server-side data caching via an
    optional setting in the Advanced
    Editor>Settings>Content:

    This will apply only to read-only data. The data is cached for
    a variable timeframe at the discretion of the server (but less
    than an hour). Please be aware that if the sheet has formulas,
    they will only be calculated when the sheet is actually
    fetched. As a result, you should not use server-side caching if
    your data has formulas that have more current content (eg: a
    formula that accesses an external site or utilizes the current
    time to compute something).</p>
