  <h1>Using your portfolio – AppSheet</h1>
  <div class="content-body article-body">
    <p>You can choose to make your apps public and display them on
    your AppSheet portfolio in order to share them with others.
    Your public apps will act as samples and users who choose to
    view or copy them will not have write access to your data nor
    will they be able to save edits with your app. They will
    simply be able to clone your apps or view them for
    instructional purposes. </p>
    <p>Please be aware that making your app public also means that
    the data within the app is also visible to a public audience.
    Do NOT do this if you have confidential data.</p>
    <p>To make an app public, you'll need to use the Advanced
    Editor>Settings>Security tab, and click the 'Sample App?'
    check box. </p>
