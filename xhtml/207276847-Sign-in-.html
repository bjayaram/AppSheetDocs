  <h1>Sign in – AppSheet</h1>
  <div class="content-body article-body">
    <p>The first step to creating apps is choosing the cloud
    provider with which you'll connect to AppSheet. We support
    Google Drive, Box, Dropbox, Office365, and Smartsheet.</p>
    <p>There are two ways to get started. The easiest way is to use
    our <a href="206559368-Create-an-app.html">add-ons for Google
    Apps</a> if you're coming from Google Forms or Google Sheets.
    Or, you can click âÄúSign inâÄù at the top right of
    the homepage. In both cases, click the appropriate cloud
    provider and sign into AppSheet with that account's
    details.</p>
    <p><em>Note: AppSheet only uses your cloud provider's
    authentication process, and does not store any of your data on
    its servers.</em> <em><a href=

    <p>
     </p>
    <p>Once you're signed in, you'll want to connect a
    spreadsheet that holds some data to AppSheet in order to begin
    creating your first app. There are a few ways to do this. If
    you're using Google Apps, you can use AppSheet's convenient
    <a href=
    "205097358-Use-AppSheet-s-add-ons-for-Google-Apps.html">Google
    Sheets and Google Forms add-ons</a>. Otherwise, you can either
    make a new app or copy one of our samples.</p>

    your spreadsheet to be AppSheet-friendly.</a></p>
