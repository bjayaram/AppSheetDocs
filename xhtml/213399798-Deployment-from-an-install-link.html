  <h1>Deployment from an install link – AppSheet</h1>
  <div class="content-body article-body">
    <p>How does a user install your app with the install link? The
    link points to a page with instructions depending on the
    combination of platform and web browser that they are
    using.</p>
    <p><strong>Chrome and Firefox on Android:</strong>Chrome
    has features which allow us to detect whether or not AppSheet
    is installed on a user's device, which greatly simplifies the
    installation process. First, they are taken to a page that
    looks like this:</p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src=
    "/hc/en-us/article_attachments/203742147/Screen_Shot_2015-11-10_at_5.16.42_PM.png"
    alt="" width="256" height="407"/></p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">
    If AppSheet is already installed, tapping the âÄúInstallâÄù
    button will open AppSheet to the app that you shared (in this
    case âÄúDriver DispatchâÄù). Additionally, it will create a
    shortcut on the user's homescreen which also points to your
    app.</p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">However, if AppSheet is
    <em>not</em> installed, the user will be taken to the following
    page:</p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src=
    "/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204003368/Screen_Shot_2015-11-10_at_5.22.33_PM.png"
    alt="" width="273" height="472"/>
    </p>
    <p>Tapping âÄúGoâÄù will redirect to the Play Store, where the
    user can install AppSheet. Once they open it for the first
    time, they will be taken to the correct app (in this case,
    âÄúDriver DispatchâÄù), and a shortcut will be placed on their
    homescreen.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Chrome Fallback to Old Install
    Experience</strong></p>
    <p>On some older phones, AppSheet cannot automatically create
    shortcuts for you, so you have the option to create it using a
    different approach. On the install page, in the bottom right,
    tap on the gray text that says "Having issues with creating
    shortcuts?" (outlined in red below)</p>
    <p><img class="wysiwyg-text-align-center" src=
    "/hc/en-us/article_attachments/205602197/fdb44af5-a6b4-4298-b392-661fb0cc4e7f_copy.png"
    alt="" width="267" height="457"/></p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Then, tap on the green "Old
    Install" button.</p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><img src=
    "/hc/en-us/article_attachments/205607958/b43bc701-fa27-444c-a414-77721026d23a.png"
    alt="" width="267" height="457"/></p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">After that, you should see a
    page that looks like the one below. Follow the old instructions
    to create a shortcut (they can be found
    here: https://appsheethelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205803927-Deployment-from-an-install-link-old-)</p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left wysiwyg-indent1"><img class=
    "wysiwyg-text-align-center" src=
    "/hc/en-us/article_attachments/205607998/40007cf7-3d0c-4f9b-899a-bb7a12b16050.png"
    alt="" width="265" height="454"/></p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><strong>Any other browser on
    Android:</strong>Browsers other than Chrome are less
    sophisticated, so this process is a bit more complicated. Once
    the user you shared your app with opens the link, they will be
    taken to a page that looks like this:</p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src=
    "/hc/en-us/article_attachments/203742187/Screen_Shot_2015-11-10_at_5.24.24_PM.png"
    alt="" width="295" height="488"/> </p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">The user is presented with
    two options: one for when AppSheet is installed, and one for
    when it is not installed. If the user does not have AppSheet,
    they should install AppSheet from the Play Store. When they
    open it, they will be taken to the app that you shared (in this
    case âÄúDriver DispatchâÄù), and a shortcut to the app will be
    placed on their homescreen.</p>
    <p>However, if AppSheet is already installed, tapping the
    second button will launch AppSheet with the correct app and
    create a shortcut on the homescreen.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><strong>Safari on iOS</strong>On iOS, Safari is the only
    supported browser at the moment. When the user opens the share
    link sent to them, they will see the following page:</p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style=
    "font-weight: 400;"><img class="wysiwyg-text-align-center" src=
    "/hc/en-us/article_attachments/203742207/Screen_Shot_2015-11-10_at_5.25.54_PM.png"
    alt="" width="281" height="461"/><strong>
    </strong></span></p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Tapping the first button
    will install AppSheet. Then they have to come back and tap the
    âÄúInstall Driver DispatchâÄù button, which will then instruct
    them to create a shortcut on their homescreen. It will look
    like this:</p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style=
    "font-weight: 400;">
    <img src=
    "/hc/en-us/article_attachments/203742227/Screen_Shot_2015-11-10_at_5.27.55_PM.png"
    alt="" width="275" height="469"/></span></p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"> </p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><strong>Any other browser on
    iOS</strong></p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Only Safari is currently
    supported on iOS. The following page is the one that opens up
    when you open the page in a browser other than iOS:</p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src=
    "/hc/en-us/article_attachments/203742297/Screen_Shot_2015-11-10_at_5.30.29_PM.png"
