  <h1>Understanding the secure flow of data – AppSheet</h1>
  <div class="content-body article-body">
    <p>AppSheet uses industry-standard security protocols and
    practices to secure your data. Users of your mobile app
    interact with a local copy of the data on the device. This
    local copy is maintained in a combination of 'HTML5 local
    storage' and the file system on the device. There are standard
    security mechanisms in place to ensure that unauthorized users
    cannot see this data.</p>
    <p>When users sync their app, changes they make are sent to the
    AppSheet web service over an encrypted protocol (HTTPS).
    AppSheet then applies the changes to the backend spreadsheet
    (on Google Drive, Dropbox, etc). The latest version of the
    spreadsheet is read (from Google Drive, Dropbox, etc) and sent
    back to the mobile app.</p>
