  <h1>Traditional vs. instant app deployment – AppSheet</h1>
  <div class="content-body article-body">
    <p>We do NOT follow the traditional app deployment model
    because it is too cumbersome.</p>
    <p>The traditional 'heavyweight' app deployment model is to
    create and submit each app separately to an app store (iTunes
    Store for iOS and Google Play Store for Android). And then your
    users find and download the app from the app store. This is
    mechanically complex-- a software developer needs to package
    code together and submit it. It is procedurally complex-- there
    are forms to fill out and an approval process. It is time
    consuming, especially as this is the process every time you
    make a small change to your app.</p>
    <p>These processes make sense if you are building a unique app
    for consumers or a broad audience. In the future, we may offer
    a 'whitelabel' service for this scenario, but it does not make
    sense if you are building an app for your team or employees.
    That's why we have created an instant app deployment
    mechanism for AppSheet. Deploying an AppSheet app is as simple
    as clicking on a link in an email and following a couple of
    instructions.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><span class=
    "wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-color-black"><strong>AppSheet's
    deployment model</strong></span></p>
    <p>AppSheet runs on iOS and Android (4.2 and above)
    devices. </p>
    <p>Instant app deployment is possible because all
    AppSheet apps (the apps you build) are "hosted" by the AppSheet
    mobile app.</p>
    <p>The essential idea behind AppSheet is that your apps are
    driven by data and configuration settings. The only unique
    aspect of each app is its data and its configuration. And
    everything else that is _common_ across apps is collected
    together into a single 'hosting' environment called the
    AppSheet mobile app.</p>
    <p>The AppSheet app already available for download in each
    mobile appstore. When you deploy and run your app, it will
    appear to run on its own, but is actually 'hosted' by the
    AppSheet app. While this is not a perfectly accurate analogy,
    it may be useful to think of your app hosted in the
    AppSheet app in just the same way that web pages are
    hosted in a web browser.</p>
    <p>You can distribute your app <a href=
    "205803927-Deployment-from-an-install-link.html">by sending
    your users an install link by email</a>. When they click on the
    link from a mobile device, they are asked to install AppSheet
    on their device (AppSheet is already available in the app
    stores) and then to install the app icon on their homescreen.
    Clicking on the icon launches the app.</p>
    <p>Your app is hosted and rendered on the mobile device using
    AppSheet as a 'runtime', just the same way different web pages
    are hosted in a browser.</p>
    <p>Beyond the obvious simplicity of this approach, there are a
    few other benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your apps are instantly available-- there is no delay
      between app creation and app deployment.</li>
      <li>Changes to your apps are instantly available too.</li>
      <li>Any system-wide changes (new features we provide, issues
      we fix, performance improvements) automatically appear in all
      apps.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In some cases, you might really want to build a traditional
    app like a software developer. White-label is a possibility for
    AppSheet apps, we are currently working on a solution for
    stand-alone apps that go in the store but the option is
    currently unavailable. While this choice is not common, you
    might consider it if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The discovery and distribution model of the appstore is
      important in your use case.</li>
      <li>You are aiming for large scale consumer adoption of your
      app.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you choose to submit an app to the iTunes or Google
    Play app stores, you need to ensure that it conforms to the
    policies of those app stores, and the approval process that
    goes along with it.</p>
    <p>We will update this entry with more details about
    White-Label in the future. </p>
