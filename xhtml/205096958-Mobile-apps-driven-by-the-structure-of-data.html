  <h1>Mobile apps 'driven' by the structure of data – AppSheet</h1>
  <div class="content-body article-body">
    <p>A mobile app created by AppSheet is completely
    driven by the structure of the data.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The app can show various pre-defined views of the data.
      As the app creator, you <a href=
      "205803457-Choosing-and-adding-data-views.html">specify and
      customize the views shown</a>.
      </li>
      <li>The individual data values are <a href=
      "205856187-Column-types.html">presented based on their
      type</a>. For example, an address is automatically geocoded
      and shown on a map. A phone number can be dialed or texted
      when selected.
      </li>
      <li>If the app permits data to be added or updated, it
      automatically generates an <a href=
      "205803767-Customizing-input-forms.html">input form based on
      the structure of the data</a>. Based on the column type, the
      input mechanism is automatically chosen. For example, an
      image column automatically launches a camera.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>So in short, the app creator defines the structure of data
    and configures the presentation of the data, but all of the
    detailed behaviors of the app are automatically driven by the
    data.</p>
