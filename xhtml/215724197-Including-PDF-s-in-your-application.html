  <h1>Including PDF's in your application – AppSheet</h1>
  <div class="content-body article-body">
    <p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">There are a
    three ways you can include PDF's in your
    application. </span></strong></p>
    <p><strong>1. Link to the PDF using a relative
    path</strong></p>
    <p>Using relative paths, you can create links to files relative
    to the spreadsheet that your app is using. This works in a
    similar way to links to image. For example, if the PDF is in
    the same directory as your spreadsheet, you can create a link
    to it just by putting in its name in your spreadsheet, eg.
    âÄòfoo.pdf'.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Link to the PDF using a direct URL</strong></p>
    <p>Using direct Url's you can link to a pdf that is somewhere
    on the internet. Just like you would link to an image, you can
    link to a pdf, for example.
    âÄòhttp://www.mywebsite.com/path/super_pdf.pdf'</p>
    <p><strong>3. Use a Google Drive URL</strong></p>
    <p>These are url's that you copy from your address bar in
    your browser when you are previewing a pdf in google drive, eg.
    âÄò<a href=
    "https://drive.google.com/view?id=1234.html">https://drive.google.com/view?id=1234</a>'</p>
    <p>Note that these are not direct or relative links, which
    means you are not supplying us with the actual PDF file. This
    means that you won't be able to take full advantage of
    AppSheet's PDF support.</p>
    <p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">How does it
    work?</span></strong></p>
    <p><strong>iOS - </strong>Regardless of the type of URL,
    the pdf will be opened in Safari. However, only relative and
    direct URL's are guaranteed to be cached for offline use.</p>
    <p><strong>Android -</strong> If you link to the PDF using a
    direct URL or relative path, the PDF will be downloaded to your
    phone, and you will be able to choose a viewer with which to
    view it. If you do not have a PDF viewer installed on your
    phone, we'll give you a link to the recommended viewer.</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Drive URL's will
    open correctly, however you will not be able to open them with
    a PDF viewer on your phone, and they are not guaranteed to be
    cached for offline use.</span></p>
