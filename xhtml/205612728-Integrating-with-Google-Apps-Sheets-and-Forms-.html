  <h1>Integrating with Google Apps (Sheets and Forms) –
  AppSheet</h1>
  <div class="content-body article-body">
    <p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">The easiest way to
    build AppSheet apps from Google Sheets and Forms is to use the
    AppSheet add-ons found in the Google add-on gallery.</span></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><span class=
    "wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Google Sheets</strong></span></p>
    <p>The <a href=
    "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/appsheet/apemmfgpjhplakdihblplkjbakedfehh?hl=en-US.html">Google
    Sheets AppSheet add-on</a> automatically converts a
    Google Sheet to an AppSheet app. It does this in one
    step:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Go</strong>: when you click "Go" from the
      AppSheet add-on pane in your Google Sheet, you are taken to
      www.appsheet.com to a working mobile app you can
      customize.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Be aware</strong></p>
    <p>Google Sheets allow you to create onEdit triggers--
    these are code functions that will run whenever a Google Sheet
    is edited via Google's web interface. However, these onEdit
    triggers do not fire when data is edited and synced to the
    spreadsheet via AppSheet. If you have important functionality
    that needs to run on updated data, we suggest moving it to a
    timed trigger (a different kind of trigger that Google
    supports). You can learn more about these different trigger
    types via the Google Docs page.</p>
    <p>Also, do not use filters on your Google Sheets --- it can
    make the filtered rows invisible to updates. Instead, use
    filter views (this is a Google Sheets feature that lets each
    user create and use their own filters without affecting other
    users of the sheet).</p>
    <p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Google
    Forms</strong></span></p>
    <p>The <a href=
    "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/appsheet/hmmicpkfdjjchdajlldfckjaanfobjob?hl=en-US.html">
    Google Forms AppSheet add-on</a> automatically converts a
    Google Form to an AppSheet app. It does this in two steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Prepare</strong>: this analyzes the form, takes
      information from the form questions and adds it to the
      response spreadsheet in the form of notes on the column
      headers</li>
      <li><strong>Launch</strong>: this creates an AppSheet app
      from the response spreadsheet.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It is important to understand that the AppSheet service
    cannot access the form itself directly-- it is only the add-on
    (a web component running in your browser) that can access the
    form. This is why the Prepare step is important.</p>
    <p>This process has a few important caveats and
    limitations that you should be aware of:</p>
    <p><strong>Adding or moving questions</strong></p>
    <p>If you add new questions or move questions around, the order
    of columns in the response spreadsheet may no longer correspond
    to the latest form content. You will need to create a new
    response spreadsheet (via the Responses menu), Prepare, and
    then Launch again.</p>
    <p><strong>Choosing AppSheet types</strong></p>
    <p>You may want to use <a href=
    "205856187-Column-types.html" target="_blank">AppSheet input
    types</a> like Photos, Signatures, etc. Those cannot be
    specified in a Google Form. So what can you do? The simple
    approach is to specify a question as being of Text type and use
    a question title that is suggestive of the type (eg" Customer
    Photo") or ("Manager Signature"), etc. AppSheet tries to
    automatically guess the type based on these titles. You can
    also change the type yourself in the Data / Column
    Structure tab of the AppSheet <a href=
    "206559378-Advanced-app-customizations.html" target=
    "_blank">Advanced Editor</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Images and Videos</strong></p>
    <p>Google Forms can contain embedded images and videos.
    Although AppSheet forms can as well, the Forms add-on is unable
    to extract embedded image and video data during the automatic
    app creation process. These fields will be given placeholder
    URLs in the generated app that you should update in the
    AppSheet <a href="206559378-Advanced-app-customizations.html"
    target="_blank">Advanced Editor</a> with correct URLs
    pointing to your image or video content.</p>
    <p><strong>Form navigation</strong></p>
    <p>Google Forms has a powerful mechanism to chain
    sections together using a "go-to-next"
    navigation model tied to answers of specific
    questions. At the end of every section, you can also specify
    to jump to another section or submit the
    form. </p>
    <p>AppSheet uses a different mechanism. In AppSheet, you
    can specify a conditional expression that controls whether or
    not a form page should be shown. The Forms add-on attempts to
    automatically generate the appropriate expressions
    based on the structure of your form.</p>
    <p>Most forms can now be correctly converted to AppSheet apps
    automatically, but there are three main limitations:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Reverse navigation is not supported by AppSheet.
      Try to arrange your form such that all navigation proceeds to
      higher section numbers.</li>
      <li>In Google Forms you can
      include a special "Other" option for
      Multiple choice questions and assign it specific navigation
      behavior. However, the navigation associated with this choice
      is not made available to the AppSheet add-on. We
      recommend avoiding use of "Other" on questions
      where "Go to section based on answer" is
      enabled.</li>
      <li>There is a practical limit to how much branching
      navigation can occur in a single form. Part of the process of
      converting to AppSheet's "Show If" navigation model requires
      building the set of all distinct paths through the
      form. The total number of paths through a
      form can quickly become unmanageable when there
      are many sections with redundant navigation options, such as
      multiple questions in the
      same section that can send the user to the
      same place. For this reason <strong>we
      strongly recommend using at most one navigating
      question per section, and marking these required
      whenever possible</strong>. Note that when more than one
      navigating question occurs in one section of a Google Form,
      only the last answered question will affect navigation
      anyway, and any others will be ignored.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For more information about building conditional
    branching forms in Google Forms and in AppSheet, see <a href=
    "206435467.html" target="_blank">this article</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Advanced options</strong></p>
    <p>Questions in Google Forms have Advanced options that let you
    constrain the type of the response. This information is
    unfortunately not made available to the add-on. However,
    you can explicitly set up equivalent behaviors in the AppSheet
    Advanced Editor.</p>
    <p><strong>Response summary</strong></p>
    <p>Google Forms has a convenient feature that shows a
    statistical distribution of responses. Unfortunately, this does
    not capture responses made via the AppSheet app-- although the
    underlying response spreadsheet has all the responses, the
    statistics are only measured on changes made through the Google
    Form itself. However, Google Sheets now has a <a href=
    "https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB8QFjAAahUKEwjaz8Hkv-_HAhWLOYgKHe0mARU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.google.com%2Fdocs%2Fanswer%2F6280499%3Fhl%3Den&amp;usg=AFQjCNFqP92py3USUhu-2hodBYBZXvEmGg.html">
    great new feature</a> that serves a similar purpose --- it is
    called "Explore" and is found via a plus button at the bottom
    right of the Google Sheet. Click on the Explore button in your
    response sheet to automatically get insights into your form
    responses.</p>
    <p><strong>Username</strong></p>
    <p>In a Google Form, you have an option at the top to collect
    the username (actually the user email) of the respondent. This
    causes an extra column 'Username' to be added to the response
    spreadsheet. Unfortunately, this column may be placed at any
    position within the spreadsheet and messes up the AppSheet
    service. We recommend therefore that if you want this
    capability, enable this option at the very end after completing
    the authoring of the rest of the form. This adds the Username
    column at the end and therefore does not cause any issues.</p>
    <p><strong>Triggers</strong></p>
    <p>If you have formSubmit triggers on the spreadsheet, they do
    not fire when updates are made via AppSheet. As with onEdit
    triggers, we recommend moving this logic to a timed
    trigger. </p>
