  <h1>Sharing and distributing your app – AppSheet</h1>
  <div class="content-body article-body">
    <p>You distribute apps by sharing an installation link. Users
    who have not yet downloaded AppSheet's mobile app from the app
    store <a href=
    "213399798-Deployment-from-an-install-link-new-.html">will be
    prompted to do so before they can install apps created with
    AppSheet onto their devices</a>.</p>
    <p>There are a few ways to distribute apps.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Sharing apps
    via the Editor</strong></span></p>
    <p>When you're ready to launch your app, click the 'Share'
    button at the left of either Editor. </p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><img src=
    "/hc/en-us/article_attachments/205019548/Screen_Shot_2016-01-22_at_7.10.43_PM.png"
    alt=""/></p>
    <p>You'll be taken to a page where you can add email addresses
    with whom you would like to share your app. An email with the
    install link will then be sent to those email
    addresses. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Other
    ways to distribute apps</strong></span></p>
    <p>Upon creation of an app, you (the creator) immediately
    receive an email with the installation link. You can also
    distribute your apps via this email, in a variety of ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You could forward that email to other users.</li>
      <li>You could copy the link onto a website to share.</li>
      <li>You could post it to Twitter and ask your followers to
      install the app.</li>
      <li>You could send the link via an SMS message.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You get the idea!</p>
    <p>At anytime, you can always go back to the Editor and
    click 'Share/Install'.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Homescreen
    shortcut installation on Android</strong></span></p>
    <p>On Android devices, you or your users can install app
    shortcuts from AppSheet's app gallery without needing to use
    the installation link. If you have downloaded the AppSheet app
    from the app store, and then open the <a href=
    "205803887-Launching-apps-from-AppSheet-s-mobile-app-gallery.html">
    app gallery</a>, click into the app you want on your
    homescreen. You will be able to install apps from there to your
    homescreen in just one step.</p>
    <p>Simply click the hamburger menu at the top left and
    then click "Add Shortcut". The current app's icon should then
    appear on the homescreen.</p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">If you'd like your users to
    use this method, just make sure you've <a href=
    "205803897-Sharing-and-distributing-your-app.html">shared the
    app</a> with them. They will see your app in the "Shared" tab
    and can follow the above instructions.</p>
