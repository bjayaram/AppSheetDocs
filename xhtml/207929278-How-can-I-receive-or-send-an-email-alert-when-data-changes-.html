  <h1>How can I receive (or send) an email alert when data changes?
  – AppSheet</h1>
  <div class="content-body article-body">
    <p>You can opt to receive an email each time data is added,
    updated, or deleted in the app. The emails fire when the
    updates are synced from the mobile device.</p>
    <p>For example, let's say I've created a Project Management
    app I'm sharing with the rest of my team to track our
    projects, assigned tasks, and progress to goal. I'd like to
    receive an email each time someone adds a new task to the app
    so I am always up to date with new assignments.</p>
    <p>I'll need to go to the Advanced
    Editor>Settings>Workflow.</p>
    <p><strong><strong><img src=

    <p>When I click +Workflow Rule, a dialog box appears called
    âÄúEdit workflow ruleâÄù. There are <a href=
    "205860137.html">several fields</a> to fill out:</p>
    <p><strong><strong><img src=

    alt="" width="571" height="331"/>

    alt="" width="573" height="328"/></strong></strong></p>
    <p>For the email subject and the attachment template, I can use
    placeholders that will populate with the correct information in
    the email. The placeholders must directly correspond to the
    column names in my spreadsheet or to AppSheet's built-in
    placeholders, case included, with the following format:
    &lt;&lt;ColumnName&gt;&gt;. (To see the complete list of
    allowed placeholders, <a href="205860137.html">click here</a>).
    You'll see I've done this in the Email subject field:</p>
    <p><strong><strong><img src=
    "/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202908728/Screen_Shot_2015-08-27_at_1.41.58_PM.png"
    alt="" width="571" height="279"/>
    </strong></strong>Instead of having the update in the body
    of the email, I instead want a PDF attached to the email that
    contains the updates. I will need to specify a Google Doc
    template with the corresponding placeholders in the document.
    Here's what my Google Doc template looks
    like:<strong><strong></strong></strong></p>
    <p><strong><strong><img src=
    "/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202908748/Screen_Shot_2015-08-21_at_4.06.27_PM.png"
    alt="" width="572" height="298"/></strong></strong>
    When I click into the âÄúAttachment templateâÄù field, I will
    get the option to choose my corresponding document from my
    Google Drive.<strong><strong></strong></strong></p>
    <p><strong><strong><img src=
    "/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202841217/Screen_Shot_2015-08-27_at_1.45.45_PM.png"
    alt="" width="573" height="280"/>
    </strong></strong>Once I hit Save I can see my new rule has
    been added:</p>
    <p><strong><strong><img src=
    "/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202841257/Screen_Shot_2015-08-21_at_3.27.11_PM.png"
    alt="" width="574" height="281"/></strong></strong></p>
    <p>Let's see this in action. In the mobile app, my colleague
    Mark just added a new task: Print Ad Sketches.</p>
    <p><strong><strong>         
                   
               
             <img src=
    "/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202841267/install7.png" alt=""
    width="188" height="359"/></strong></strong></p>
    <p>When Mark synced the device, I received the workflow
    email:</p>
    <p><strong><strong><img src=
    "/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202841277/Screen_Shot_2015-08-21_at_4.23.34_PM.png"
    alt="" width="571" height="330"/></strong></strong></p>
    <p>Attached to the email is the PDF with the appropriate data
    replacing the placeholders:</p>
    <p><strong><strong><img src=
    "/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202841307/Screen_Shot_2015-08-21_at_4.27.13_PM.png"
    alt="" width="570" height="261"/></strong></strong></p>
    <p>We've focused on email in this article. Going forward,
    AppSheet will support a variety of other actions for workflow
    rules-- including text messages, push notifications, webhooks
    and more. </p>
    <p>Please note that while the app is in test mode
    (i.e. it has not passed a <a href=
    "205803947-Check-your-app-for-deployment.html">Deployment
    Check</a>), any messages sent from workflow actions will go
    only to the app creator.</p>
