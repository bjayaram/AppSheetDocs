  <h1>Check your app for deployment – AppSheet</h1>
  <div class="content-body article-body">
    <p>There are a few simple checks to make sure your app is ready
    for use and deployment.</p>
    <p>On the app editor page, click the <strong>Manage</strong>
    button and run a Deployment check. AppSheet verifies that
    your app is ready to deploy-- if not, it informs you about
    steps you need to take.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>One class of checks is associated with the app definition
      and the underlying data. Any errors or warnings will be
      highlighted.</li>
      <li>An app must be assigned a launch icon and description
      before deployment.</li>
      <li>Because app security is really important, the deployment
      check includes a security review.</li>
      <li>Finally, AppSheet ensures that the features used by the
      app are compatible with your account type.</li>
