    <p>If you want to permanently remove an app, you can simply
    delete it. The next time any existing users sync the app, it
    will no longer run.</p>
    <p>If you just want to remove specific users from an app that
    requires user sign in, then removing them from the app
    whitelist suffices. The next time they sync, the app will
    prompt them for signin and that will fail.</p>
