  <h1>Column types – AppSheet</h1>
  <div class="content-body article-body">
    <p>Here is a list of available column/data types. We
    expect this list to grow over time...</p>
    <p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium"><strong>Text
    types</strong></span></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 2em">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Text</strong>: models a short piece of text (a
        few words) shown on single line.</li>
        <li><strong>Name</strong>: special case of a Text type that
        represents the name of a person or place. </li>
        <li><strong>LongText</strong>: models longer text content
        shown across several lines.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium"><strong>Numeric
    types</strong></span> - in the app, values of these
    types can be graphed.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Number</strong>: models an integer value.</li>
      <li><strong>Decimal</strong>: models a number with decimal
      precision.</li>
      <li><strong>Price</strong>: models currency values. The
      TypeQualifier field can be used to indicate a currency symbol
      ($ is the default).</li>
      <li><strong>Percent</strong>: represents percentage
      values.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><span class=
    "wysiwyg-font-size-medium"><strong>Temporal
    types </strong>-</span></span> in the app, these
    values are shown utilizing the timezone and presentation format
    of the client device.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Date</strong>: models a day
      (day-month-year).</li>
      <li><strong>Time</strong>: models a time within a day
      (hour-minute-second).</li>
      <li><strong>DateTime</strong>: models the day and the
      time.</li>
      <li><strong>Duration</strong>: models a period of time.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium"><strong>Change
    types</strong></span> - in some apps, it is important to
    record a timestamp or increment a counter automatically in a
    row when changes are made to other columns, and even _values_
    within the columns. The change types provide this
    functionality. When the Type Qualifier is empty, these change
    types automatically update when _any_ other column value
    changes. However, they can be constrained to react to changes
    only on specific other columns by providing a Type Qualifier of
    the form: {"ChangeColumns":["Column1", "Column2"]}. Change
    types can be constrained to react to changes on certain values
    using this format in the Type Qualifier:
    {âÄúChangeColumnsâÄù:[âÄúColumn1âÄù],
    âÄúChangeValuesâÄù:[âÄúfailedâÄù,âÄùerrorâÄù,âÄùurgentâÄù]}.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>ChangeTimestamp</strong>: shows when an entry was
        last edited. See how this works along with a Type Qualifier
        in the <a class="TutorialAppExample" href=
        "https://www.appsheet.com/Template/ShowDef?appName=ProductInventory-10305.html"
        target="_blank">Store Inventory sample.</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>ChangeCounter</strong>: shows how many times an
        entry has been edited. See how this works without a Type
        Qualifier in the <a class="TutorialAppExample" href=
        "https://www.appsheet.com/Template/ShowDef?appName=InterviewFeedback-10305.html"
        target="_blank">Interview Feedback sample.</a>
      </li>
      <li><strong>ChangeLocation</strong>: will automatically
      populate with the current GPS location (where the change was
      made).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">Enumerated
    types</span></strong> - in the app, fields of these types
    are constrained to having one of a fixed list of allowed
    values.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Yes/No</strong>: also known as a 'Boolean' type,
      these values display as Y or N in the app and have a 'slider'
      choice mechanism in input forms.</li>
      <li><strong>Enum</strong>: models a text value that must
      belong to a specific list. The TypeQualifier contains the
      list of allowed values. This is typically generated
      automatically from data validation rules in your
      spreadsheet.
      
      You also have the ability to allow users to manually
      input data into dropdown menus instead of only having the
      option to choose from the dropdown list. To do this, choose
      the Enum type, and in the type qualifier, for example:
      {"EnumValues":["One","Two","Three"],"AllowOtherValues":true}

      
      When you have an enum that allows for the option "Other",
      typing in the box will allow you to choose from a set of
      values in order to autocomplete the entry. This allows users
      to choose from common entries that have already been
      submitted, as well as to ensure all entries are submitted the
      same way, avoiding typos.
      </li>
      <li><strong>EnumList</strong>: allows the user to select
      multiple answers on a question. The TypeQualifier contains
      the list of allowed values. This is typically generated
      automatically from data validation rules in your
      spreadsheet.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ref</strong>: an advanced feature that models a
        value that must be the key of another table or slice. The
        TypeQualifier contains the name of the referenced table or
        slice. See how table references work in the <a class=
        "TutorialAppExample" href=
        "https://www.appsheet.com/Template/ShowDef?appName=OrderCapture-10305.html"
        target="_blank">Order Capture sample.</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Color</strong>: color code entries in your app with
        a subset of 6 standard colors: Red, Yellow, Green, Orange,
         Purple, and Blue.
        See how color coding works in the <a class=
        "TutorialAppExample" href=
        "https://www.appsheet.com/Template/ShowDef?appName=MarketingPlan-10305.html"
        target="_blank">Project Plan sample.</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Progress</strong>: show the progress of an entry by
        utilizing a âÄòHarvey Ball' ideogram. See how the
        progress function works in the <a class=
        "TutorialAppExample" href=
        "https://www.appsheet.com/Template/ShowDef?appName=MarketingPlan-10305.html"
        target="_blank">Project Plan sample.
        </a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">Communication
    types</span></strong> - in the app, values of these types
    can be tapped to launch communication.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Phone</strong>: models a phone number -- gives
      you the option to both call and SMS text through the app.
       
      
      At present, AppSheet only automatically recognizes phone
      numbers in North American format. We hope to improve this in
      the future to recognize international phone numbers as
      well.
      
      You can overcome this limitation by using the Advanced editor
      and manually setting the column type to Phone. Once you do
      this, AppSheet will treat the column as a phone number, and
      the column type setting will be preserved across schema
      regeneration.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Email</strong>: models an email address -- gives
      you the ability to send emails by clicking the email
      address. 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><span class=
    "wysiwyg-font-size-medium"><strong>Geographic
    types</strong></span> </span>- in the app, values of
    these types can be seen on a map.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Address</strong>: models a fully-specified postal
      address.
      
      You can store address information in AppSheet by creating
      adjacent columns in your worksheet and naming them
      appropriately. When you do this, AppSheet automatically
      recognized that the adjacent columns form an address. For
      example, you can create adjacent columns in your
      worksheet, and name them âÄúStreetâÄù, âÄúCityâÄù,
      âÄúStateâÄù, âÄúZipâÄù. In this case, AppSheet
      will recognize that taken together these columns
      represent an address and it will create a "Computed
      AddressâÄù field that concatenates the values in these
      address fields.
      
      AppSheet can also handle multi-line âÄúStreetâÄù addresses,
      so you can name your columns âÄúStreet1âÄù, âÄúStreet2âÄù,
      âÄúStreet3âÄù, âÄúCityâÄù, StateâÄù, ZipâÄù, if your
      application requires multiple lines of street information.
      This can be useful if you need to extend the address
      information with apartment numbers, unit numbers, attention,
      care of, or other such, address information.
      
      AppSheet is also capable of handling two or more addresses in
      the same worksheet. For example, your worksheet might contain
      both a âÄúHome AddressâÄù and a âÄúWork AddressâÄù. AppSheet
      recognizes the two addresses based upon a combination of
      naming and adjacency. Keep the âÄúHome AddressâÄù columns
      adjacent to one another and likewise for the âÄúWork
      AddressâÄù columns. Then name the columns to help AppSheet
      group them appropriately. For example, you might name the
      "Home Address" columns âÄúHome StreetâÄù, âÄúHome CityâÄù,
      âÄúHome StateâÄù, âÄúHome ZipâÄù. You might name the "Work
      Address" columns âÄúWork Street1âÄù, âÄúWork Street2âÄù,
      âÄúWork CityâÄù, âÄúWork StateâÄù, âÄúWork ZipâÄù. You can
      use this approach to include three or more addresses in your
      worksheet, if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>LatLong</strong>: models a latitude and a longitude
        (eg: '48.5564, -122.3421'). Form fields for this data type
        can fill in the current location with a single click. See
        how location capture works in the <a class=
        "TutorialAppExample" href=
        "https://www.appsheet.com/Template/ShowDef?appName=SiteInspection-10305.html"
        target="_blank">Site Inspection sample.
        </a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">Content
    types</span></strong> - in the app, values of these types
    are shown as inline content, or open in an external content
    viewer.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Drawing</strong>: creates a drawing pad in the
      app. </li>
      <li><strong>Image</strong>: models .jpg, .png and .gif
      images. The values may be image urls or names of files in the
      source file system of the spreadsheet. Please reference the
      section describing how to use files as images. Images are
      captured on the device using the camera or from the local
      camera roll.</li>
      <li><strong>Thumbnail</strong>: also models images, but
      instructs the app to expect small icons and thumbnails.
      Thumbnails are captured just like images.</li>
      <li><strong>Signature</strong>: models user signatures. These
      are captured using a touch-based signature pad and are stored
      as small inline images in the spreadsheet.</li>
      <li><strong>File</strong>: models any file content that can
      be viewed in a browser (typically used for PDF documents).
      There is no capture mechanism for files in the app.</li>
      <li><strong>URL</strong>: models any web address.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Show</strong>: empty columns in your
        spreadsheet that serve the sole purpose of improving the
        presentation of <strong>data capture forms</strong>. There
        are six categories of show types:
        <ol>
          <li>Page_Header: used to create a new page within the
          form</li>
          <li>Section_Header: used to create a new section within
          the same form page</li>
          <li>Text: used to show some descriptive text</li>
          <li>Url: used to show a clickable url</li>
          <li>Image: used to show a static image</li>
          <li>Video: used to show an MP4 video</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong><span class=
    "wysiwyg-font-size-medium">
    System types</span></strong> </span>- these are meant for
    internal use only and should not be explicitly assigned by
    AppSheet users in the current version.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>MultiColumnKey</strong>: a composite field
      representing the combination of multiple fields for the
      purpose of a key.</li>
      <li><strong>App</strong>: represents an AppSheet app
      handle.</li>
