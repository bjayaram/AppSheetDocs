  <div class="content-body article-body">
    <p>What happens when the user clicks on an app shortcut to
    launch the app?</p>
    <p>Remember that your app is actually hosted on the <a href=
    "205111288-Traditional-vs-instant-app-deployment.html">AppSheet
    mobile runtime</a>. So when the user launches your app, it
    first loads AppSheet (which you do not see) and then starts
    your app. The whole process only takes a few seconds, after
    which the user can start using your app. Your app looks
    and behaves exactly as it did in the emulator on our
    website.</p>
