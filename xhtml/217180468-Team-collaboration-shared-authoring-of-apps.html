      Oftentimes, app creators would like to share app authoring
      with other team members. With team collaboration, app
      creators may enable app view or edit rights for other team
      members. The app creator remains the app owner and may grant
      or remove access rights for others. View App Collaborators
      may view the app definition and the supporting spreadsheets,
      while Edit App Collaborators may edit the app definition and
      the supporting spreadsheets.

      <strong>Please be aware that it is wise to have only one user
      edit an app at any point in time. If two users are editing
      the same app at the same time, attempts to save conflicting
      edits will fail. App Editors are not notified if there is
      another editor changing the app.</strong>

    <p>Note: <strong>Collaboration rights apps</strong> will
    be displayed in the <strong>My Apps</strong> section, but
    currently are indistinguishable from <strong>owned
    apps.</strong> In addition, neither the app owner's name nor
    the specific right (view or edit) is displayed.</p>
