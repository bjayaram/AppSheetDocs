   <title>Who should use AppSheet and what kind of apps can it create?
  â€“ AppSheet</title>
   <body>
      <p>AppSheet allows anyone to create elegant, powerful, and
    useful applications for business, professional, or personal
    needs.</p>
      <p>If you are computer savvy and use online tools to manage
    your life and work, AppSheet is meant for you, and hundreds of
    millions of others like you.</p>
      <p>It generally takes complex programming to build useful
    applications. However, AppSheet enables a limited but important
    subset of apps-- those that follow a simple data-driven
    pattern. The behavior of an AppSheet app is almost completely
    determined by the structure of your data. That's why you can
    build an app without writing any code.</p>
      <p>You can build apps for project management, field operations,
    customer service, team collaboration, task management,
    staffing, and so much more. </p>
      <p>AppSheet apps are designed to work offline-- you can control
    and enable various aspects of online behavior.</p>
