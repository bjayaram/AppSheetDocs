   <title>Who can discover and install your app? â€“ AppSheet</title>
   <body>
      <p>AppSheet does not have an app store or any other environment
    for others to discover your apps. This is by design. You decide
    to tell others about your app by sharing an install link. And
    your existing users can share the app install link with others
    as well. Of course, if someone decides to post your app's
    install link on Twitter, this could be a good thing or a bad
    thing for you!</p>
      <p>If you want further controls on your app, enable the setting
    that requires users to sign in before using your app. When you
    do this, you have to explicitly add users to your app's user
    whitelist. Nobody else will be able to start the
    app. <b>You can do this in the Basic
    Editor&gt;Settings tab, and the Advanced
    Editor&gt;Settings&gt;Security tab.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Click the checkbox next to 'Require User
    Authentication'. </p>

      <p>
    Then click the 'Manage user whitelist' link that appears.
    You'll be taken to a whitelist administration page where you
    can either enter individual email addresses or entire domain
    names that are allowed to access your application.</p>
      <p>When you have a relatively small number of users, it is
    easiest to enter individual email addresses for each user.</p>
      <p>When you have lots of users, they are all members of the
    same domain, and everyone in the domain is permitted to use the
    application, it is easiest to enter a domain name. Some
    authentication providers offer the option of creating and
    registering your own domain name. You can then assign email
    addresses using that domain name. For example, you might create
    a domain like "mycompany.com" and assign email address like
    "BobSmith@mycompany.com" and "MaryJones@ mycompany.com". By
    entering "mycompany.com" in the whitelist, you allow everyone
    having an email account with the domain name "mycompany.com" to
    access your application. You can learn more about creating and
    registering domain names and assigning email addresses by
    searching for "Google Apps for Work". Other authentication
    providers have similiar offerings.</p>
      <p>For your safety, we prevent you from entering widely used
    domain names in the whitelist, such as "google.com".</p>
