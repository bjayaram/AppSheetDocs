   <title>What if I lose connectivity? â€“ AppSheet</title>
   <body>
      <p>If you expect your app to be offline for any non-trivial
    period of time, we strongly recommend configuring the app to
    indicate that it should work offline. AppSheet has platform
    features that explicitly handle this scenario.</p>
      <p>However, even for apps that have not enabled this feature,
    AppSheet is designed to work through transient connectivity
    failures. Mobile apps work in occasionally connected
    environments, and network failures do occur.</p>
      <ul>
      
         <li>All changes are made locally and are queued up to send
      over the network when you choose to sync.</li>
      
         <li>During Sync, if any changes fail to be propagated, they
      are retried. Our system is designed so that the changes are
      'idempotent'-- this means that even if we mistakenly try to
      apply the same change repeatedly, the result is still
      sensible.</li>
      
         <li>You can keep using the app until you get to a location
      with reliable connectivity and successfully sync your
      changes.</li>
    
      </ul>
