   <title>Tables â€“ AppSheet</title>
   <body>
      <p>The first step for your data to become an AppSheet app is to
    be added as a table to the template of the app. It means the
    data is still going to be in your spreadsheet, the table is
    simply a "model" of the rows and columns in it. This is the
    first step in creating an App Definition.</p>
      <p>
         <b>This is how we see columns and rows in
    AppSheet:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
         <b>Columns:</b> AppSheet reads each column header
    to define the Column Structure of the app. Every time you
    change the columns in the spreadsheet, then you need to
    regenerate the column structure in the app or AppSheet won't
    know how to locate the columns to read/write data. Column
    headers are essential to your app, you need column headers for
    each column where you want to collect data</p>
      <p>
         <b>Rows:</b> Every time you add new data, a new
    row will be added to the spreadsheet. This is very important to
    understand. You want the columns in your table to never or
    rarely change while the rows can change as needed by adding,
    deleting or updating new data. </p>
      <p>
         <b>Adding Multiple Tables</b>
      </p>
      <p>To add multiple tables after you created your app, go to
    Advanced Edit &gt; Data &gt; Tables and add a new table:</p>

         </image>
      </p>
      <p>AppSheet will ask you to select a new file, if you have
    multiple data sources, it will prompt you to select a new data
    source; it can be the same spreadsheet or a completely new one
    from a different data source. Great for data mashups!</p>
      <p>When you add a new table - or when you are editing an
    existing table - you can choose how data is accessed in the
    app. You can allow people to Add, Update, Delete or any
    combination of those three. </p>
      <p>

         </image>
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>You can also choose a specific tab inside the table by
    adding its exact name in the Worksheet Qualifier
    field. </p>
      <p>Tables are the first step for a solid AppSheet app. And you
    can bring a lot of richness with multiple tables and data
    access levels.  </p>
      <p>
         <b> A few tips for tables:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
      
         <li>You can add the same spreadsheet any times you need. This
      is useful if you want to use one table for read only (show
      data) and the same data table to capture data in a different
      view. </li>
      
         <li>Even though AppSheet can see the row number in a
      spreadsheet, it doesn't locate the row by it's number but
      rather by a data point in one of the columns. That's where
      the concept of <xref href="206096807-Specifying-a-key.dita">Keys</xref> become essential
      in an AppSheet app
      </li>
      
         <li>Using keys as a way to locate rows in the spreadsheet
      also allows for multiple users adding data at the same time.
      AppSheet will "serialize" the data going back to the
      spreadsheet from the app, letting the last person to write in
      a cell to "win".</li>
