   <title>Launching apps from AppSheet's mobile app gallery â€“
  AppSheet</title>
   <body>
      <p>We encourage you to install your apps' icons to your
    homescreen when you're ready to deploy them. However, there are
    a handful of reasons you may want to use apps without having to
    first install them to your phone. </p>
      <p>All of the apps you create with AppSheet are available
    via AppSheet's mobile app that you <xref href="213399798-Deployment-from-an-install-link-new-.dita">downloaded
    from the app store</xref>. Likewise, AppSheet's app also features
    a gallery of public sample apps and the apps that others have
    shared with you. You may want to use these apps without having
    to install them. Here's how to do it:</p>
      <ol>
      
         <li>Launch the AppSheet mobile app on your mobile device. It
      will ask you to log in. Do so with the same account you used
      for app creation.</li>
      
         <li outputclass="wysiwyg-text-align-left">You can choose to view
      "My Apps", "Public", and "Shared". Choose a view, then
      click 'Sync' to download the most updated version of each
      app.

         </li>
      
         <li>This deployment approach is best suited for development
      and testing, especially if you build many apps.</li>
    
      </ol>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Note: once you are using the app you have launched from the
    app gallery, and if you are using an Android device, you have
    the option to add that app's icon to your homescreen for future
    ease of use. To do so, <xref href="205803897.dita">please refer to
