   <title>Team collaboration, shared authoring of apps â€“ AppSheet</title>
   <body>
      <p>Oftentimes, app creators would like to share app authoring with other team members. With
         team collaboration, app creators may enable app view or edit rights for other team members.
         The app creator remains the app owner and may grant or remove access rights for others.
         View App Collaborators may view the app definition and the supporting spreadsheets, while
         Edit App Collaborators may edit the app definition and the supporting spreadsheets.</p>
      <p><b>Please be aware that it is wise to have only one user edit an app at any point in time.
            If two users are editing the same app at the same time, attempts to save conflicting
            edits will fail. App Editors are not notified if there is another editor changing the
            app.</b></p>
      <ol id="ol_dvk_3kd_gv">
         <li>To enable this feature, select the <b>Advanced Editor</b> from the left sidebar.

      Once added, you may choose to either allow your collaborators to edit or view the
      app. The default selection is <b>"Can Edit."</b>

      <p>Note: <b>Collaboration rights apps</b> will be displayed in the <b>My Apps</b> section, but
         currently are indistinguishable from <b>owned apps.</b> In addition, neither the app
         owner's name nor the specific right (view or edit) is displayed.</p>
