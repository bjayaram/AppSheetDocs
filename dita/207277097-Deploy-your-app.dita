   <title>Deploy your app â€“ AppSheet</title>
   <body>
      <p>In order to get your apps onto your device, you must first
    download the AppSheet app from your device's app store. Any
    subsequent apps you create essentially run through the AppSheet
    app. You can read more about this deployment model <xref href="205111288-Traditional-vs-instant-app-deployment.dita">here</xref>.</p>
      <p>If you are an app creator, it is a good idea to install the
    AppSheet mobile app on your mobile device even if you won't
    be a user of the app. You may want to test your app out on your
    own device before launching to your users. You can find
    AppSheet's app by searching for AppSheet in the iTunes store
    (for iOS devices) or Google Play store (for Android
    devices).</p>
      <p>When you launch the AppSheet app, it asks you to sign in,
    after which it starts an <xref href="205803887-Launching-apps-from-AppSheet-s-mobile-app-gallery.dita">
    App Gallery</xref> (itself an app created by AppSheet!). The App
    Gallery lets you browse and run your apps, apps that have been
    shared with you, or public samples on your mobile
    device. 
    </p>

      <p>This becomes a convenient mechanism for app creators to test
    their apps on their own mobile device in the process of
    building and modifying the app definition, without having to
    actually install the apps themselves to the homescreen.</p>
      <p>You can distribute your app by sending your users (or
    yourself) an install link by email. Just click the
    Share button at the left of the app Editor.

      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Then you'll be able to enter in the email addresses (or full
    domain) of those you'd like to share the app with. </p>

      <p>This is what the email looks like:

         </image>
    
      </p>
      <p>When your users click on the link from a mobile device, they
    are asked to install AppSheet on their device (AppSheet is
    already available in the app stores).</p>
      <p>Installation is easy. Find out more about installation
