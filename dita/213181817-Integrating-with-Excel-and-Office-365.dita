   <title>Integrating with Excel and Office 365 â€“ AppSheet</title>
   <body>
      <p>An easy way to build AppSheet apps from Excel is
    to use the <xref href="https://store.office.com/appsheet-mobile-apps-from-spreadsheets-WA104379644.aspx?assetid=WA104379644&amp;sourcecorrid=75a881ae-d527-4cd9-bdc0-df51489c3996&amp;searchapppos=0.html" scope="external" format="html">AppSheet
    add-on</xref> found in the Office add-in store.</p>
      <p>While this process is mostly seamless, there are some
    specific behaviors to be aware of. With Office365, if one user
    has the spreadsheet open for editing, other users and third
    party apps like AppSheet cannot make updates to the
    spreadsheet. Consequently, if you intend to build an app that
    updates the data (as most apps do!), please make sure to close
    the spreadsheet first. Otherwise, you will see conflict ("409")
    error messages and the app will not able to save changes to the
    spreadsheet.</p>
