         <p class="p">AppSheet automatically extracts structure from a spreadsheet
            so that your app can be generated. While most spreadsheets are
            simple tabular structures, there are also ways to use
            spreadsheets that are incompatible with AppSheet. So you may
            see errors, warnings, and informaton messages in the app editor
            when AppSheet reads your spreadsheet. 
         </p>

            <li class="li">
               <span class="ph wysiwyg-underline">Errors with spreadsheet
                  structure</span> -- these errors typically occur when
               AppSheet is unable to properly identify the column headers.
               Often this is because the first worksheet in your spreadsheet
               has non-tabular data like charts or pictures.

               <span class="ph wysiwyg-underline">Errors when switching
                  spreadsheets</span> -- when you switch to a different
               spreadsheet, AppSheet tries to retain as much as possible of
               your existing app. However, the new spreadsheet may have a
               totally different column structure. In this case, you may see
               errors that ask you to change the other parts of the app
               definition appropriately.
            </li>

               <span class="ph wysiwyg-underline">Warnings about column
                  structure mismatch</span> -- this is the most common warning
               seen during the app creation process. As users modify their
               spreadsheets, they add or remove columns. Each time you do
               this and tell AppSheet to refresh the column structure, you
               are warned if the old column structure and new structure do
               not align. AppSheet always adjusts to the new structure, so
               this is a warning, not an error.
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">
               <span class="ph wysiwyg-underline">Warnings about
                  formulas</span> -- we discuss formulas in a separate topic,
               but in brief, there are only certain kinds of spreadsheet
               formulas that make sense to use in your data.
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">
               <span class="ph wysiwyg-underline">Information about the key
                  column</span> -- as described earlier, this information tells
               you which column is chosen as the key. The key also plays an
               important part in the presentation of data as described in
               the UX section. If AppSheet cannot find a good key column, it
               tries to combine pairs of columns to find a composite key. If
               that also fails, it settles for the row number (an implicit
               column). This is typically not a good choice unless you have
               an app that is purely showing information and prevents all
               edits. The number of a row in a spreadsheet changes
               dynamically based on the rows above it, so clearly the row
               number identifies a row only as long as no rows are being
               added or deleted to the spreadsheet by the app, or
               directly.
