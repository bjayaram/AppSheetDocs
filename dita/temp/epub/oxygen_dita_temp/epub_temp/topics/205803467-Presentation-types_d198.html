      <h1 class="title topictitle1">Presentation types – AppSheet</h1>
      
      <div class="body">
         
         <p class="p">AppSheet supports five presentation views-- <strong class="ph b">list,
               image gallery, map, chart,</strong> and
            <strong class="ph b">form</strong>.
            
            All of the views show a 'summary' view of the data with the
            ability to drill into a 'detailed' view of one specific entry.
            As with other aspects of AppSheet, the platform automatically
            generates most of the UX and the app creator guides the outcome
            primarily be changing the structure of the data.
         </p>
         
         
         <ul class="ul">
            
            
            <li class="li">
               <strong class="ph b">List</strong>-- this is the default view of
               tabular data. There are three display styles to
               choose from:
               
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">Tabular: each row is showed in a compact representation.
               Tapping or clicking on a row expands it to show all the
               details. An extra option specifies the column to sort the
               data on. You can choose to sort the data in ascending or
               descending order.
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">Grouped: rows are grouped together based on the value in
               the grouping column specified. Within each group, the data is
               shown using the tabular view and sorted based on the order of
               data in the underlying spreadsheet.
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">Deck: this is a special presentation for data that has an
               image column. The data is displayed as a stack of 'cards',
               and clicking on any of them expands the card and its image.
               The deck view allows for round and square image
               presentations. 
            </li>

         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">2. <strong class="ph b">Gallery</strong>-- this is the default view of
            data that has an image or thumbnail image column. The content
            is shown in a 'summary' view as an image gallery where each
            image is annotated with the row key. Clicking on any image
            opens up a full screen 'details' view of the image along with
            the other row columns. Once in the full screen details view,
            the user can swipe left or right to move to adjacent rows. This
            presentation has three sub-options that control the size of the
            images shown in the summary view:
         </p>
         
         
         <ul class="ul">
            
            
            <li class="li">Small: appropriate for thumbnail images.</li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">Medium: fits two images side by side on a phone
               screen.
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">Large: shows large images full-width with a vertical
               scroll.
            </li>
            
            
            
         </ul>
         
         
         <p class="p">As with the List view, you can choose a column to sort the
            order of presentation of the data. <a href="https://www.appsheet.com/Template/SimpleDef?appName=ProductCatalog-10305.html" class="xref">

         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">3. <strong class="ph b">Map</strong>-- the map view only makes sense if
            you have an Address column. When you choose the Map view,
            AppSheet automatically picks up the data from your Address
            column, geocodes those addresses, and shows them on a map.

         <p class="p">4. <strong class="ph b">Chart</strong>-- we support a number of different
            chart presentations. In general, charting is a complex topic.
            As the designer of a chart, you typically have to make three
            choices:
         </p>
         
         
         <ul class="ul">
            
            
            <li class="li">How many individual series 'lines' do you draw?</li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">What values are on the X and Y axes?</li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">What chart display type do you use-- line, bar chart,
               etc.
            </li>
            
            
            
         </ul>
         
         
         <p class="p">We have tried to keep it simple by limiting the possible
            answers for each of these choices:
         </p>
         
         
         <ul class="ul">
            
            
            <li class="li">Row Series chart-- this is appropriate for spreadsheet
               data where most of the data is numeric on a uniform scale
               (eg: monthly sales data). Every row forms a series, each of
               which is identified by the row key. You choose a subset of
               the column names that will be charted on the X axis. The Y
               axis is based on the numeric values in the row cells. You can
               choose a line chart, a bar chart, or a stacked bar chart as
               the display type. A good example of a Row Series chart is the
               'By Month' view in the <a href="https://www.appsheet.com/Template/ShowDef?appName=DataInsight-10305.html" class="xref">
                  Sales Report sample.</a>
               
               
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">Column Series chart-- this is appropriate for spreadsheet
               data with just a few rows corresponding to items to compare
               (eg: monthly sales data by category). Every column forms a
               series, each of which is identified by the column name. Each
               row (using its row key column) forms one entry on the X axis.
               The Y axis is based on the numeric values in the row cells.
               You can choose a line chart, a bar chart or a stacked bar
               chart as the display type. A good example of a Column Series
               chart is the 'By Type' view in the <a href="https://www.appsheet.com/Template/ShowDef?appName=DataInsight-10305.html" class="xref">
                  Sales Report sample.</a>
               
               
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">Histogram-- this is a special kind of bar chart to show
               aggregate distributions. For example, if you want to see the
               number of customers who purchased each automobile model, you
               specify the column whose values will be aggregated. The X
               axis gets one entry for each unique value in this column and
               the Y axis shows the count of the number of rows that have
               that value in that column.
            </li>
            
            
            
         </ul>
         
         
         <p class="p">5: <strong class="ph b">Form</strong>-- Your apps give you the
            ability to capture signatures, photos, and location
            services.You can use AppSheet for Google Forms to both
            distribute forms through a mobile app as well as use a mobile
            app to view and interact with form responses. But if you're
            only using your app to distribute forms, you probably don't
            want your app showing each user's response, and instead have
            each new user simply be able to fill out a new form with the
            app.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">To do this, click the UX tab in either editor. In the Basic
            Editor, choose 'form' from the dropdown list of presentation
            view types. In the Advanced Editor, click the UX tab, then
            'Controls'. From there choose 'form' from the dropdown list of
            presentation view types under the Action field.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">New guests to the form will only be able to fill out a new
            form and will not see entries made by previous users.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">AppSheet also helps you unlock mobile-specific features for
            your Forms that the web cannot capture. Your apps give you the
            ability to capture signatures, photos, and location
            services.

         <p class="p">6. <strong class="ph b">Deck</strong>-- A view that displays a large
            image on the left, in your choice of either a
            round, square, or full presentation, with the most
            important information on the right and any action buttons that
            correspond to your field types.

         <p class="p">Over time, we will add more chart types, while trying to
