      <div class="body">
         
         <p class="p">AppSheet has different subscription plans as described on
            the <a href="https://www.appsheet.com/home/pricing.html" class="xref">Pricing
               page</a>.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">All</strong> basic app functionality is
            available for free for prototypes and purely personal use. All
            use in business and professional settings requires a paid plan.
            All the same, every app feature and behavior can be
            tested for free until you are ready to deploy. In short, your
            app will function even if you haven't yet selected a plan.
            <strong class="ph b">If features of your app do not work, it is not
               because of the plan you are on.</strong> Of course, it is good
            karma to be on the right plan, and good karma always helps.
            :-)
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">The app editor indicates that certain app
            behaviors (eg: security, offline, content optimization,
            team collaboration, etc.) always require paid plans. When your
            app definition enables these features, AppSheet knows for sure
            that you are not building an app as a prototype or for personal
            use. The use of these features may lead to a warning message
            that tells you that a plan upgrade is required. Even if you are
            not using these features, if your app is used in a business
            setting, you should be on a paid subscription plan.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">The per-user subscription plans involve a variable cost
            component depending on the number of unique users of the app.
            AppSheet monitors this usage and you, the app creator, can see
            approximate historical usage statistics for each of your apps
            on the Activity tab of your Account page. At the current
            moment, AppSheet does not warn you when the user limits are
            reached, but will do so in the future.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">We do not ever plan to prevent access to the app if
            the user limits are reached -- rather, we expect to record and
            warn the app creator of this situation. However, the preferred
            route is for the app creator to anticipate and purchase
            the appropriate plan based on the expected usage. 
         </p>
