      <div class="body">
         
         <p class="p">AppSheet apps are designed for offline function. There are
            four elements to offline behavior as described below, and
            they are controlled by the app creator. AppSheet apps can
            work offline because the information needed to run the app (the
            app definition, the data, and optionally images)
            is maintained locally on the mobile device.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">One important pre-condition for all offline access
               is that the app must initially be launched on the device when
               it is online.</strong> The process of launching the app on the
            device causes the appropriate information to be downloaded and
            cached locally.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">Offline behavior is controlled via the Advanced
            Editor&gt;Settings&gt;Content tab. The use of these
            features does require the Premium subscription plan.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Delayed sync</strong>: 'Sync' is the step that sends
            data updates from the device to the backend and brings back the
            latest app definition and data from the backend. If you choose
            Delayed Sync for your app, it indicates that the app will not
            sync data immediately when a new edit/delete/add occurs.
            Rather, it will just be queued up until you explicitly choose
            to sync. You should select this option for apps that are
            expected to work in offline environments or where you want to
            control the use of data bandwidth on the device.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Intermittent connectivity</strong>: Apps that
            don't enable Delayed Sync will synchronize changes every time
            that data changes on the device. However, there may be
            connectivity issues that prevent this from happening. Even in a
            mostly connected environment, there can be intermittent network
            outages. If such failures occur, AppSheet automatically queues
            up the changes that fail to send-- in other words, the app will
            default to a delayed sync behavior if the attempt to sync
            fails. This is the default behavior and prevents loss of data.
            Furthermore, repeated retries will not cause any duplication or
            corruption of data (except for the special case where you use
            RowNumber as your key-- please read our warning article about
            that).
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Viewing content
               offline</strong>:<strong class="ph b"> </strong>All spreadsheet/table
            data content is always copied locally on the device so that it
            is available offline by default. However, the images and
            documents associated with the app and data are not (these are
            typically much larger and so we need do not maintain a local
            copy). You can explicitly enable a setting that instructs
            AppSheet to make an offline copy of all image and document
            content. As with all other offline data caching, this copy
            occurs when the app is initially run on the mobile device
            (online) and is subsequently checked and refreshed as needed
            when Sync occurs.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Launching offline</strong>: If you have used the
            lightweight deployment mechanism, you are familiar with
            launching apps from their homescreen icons. By default, a
            mobile device needs to be online in order to launch an app from
            its homescreen icon. Once launched, the app can then
            function offline or with intermittent connectivity. However, if
            you need the app to launch when the device is offline, this is
            an option you must explicitly set in the app
            definition.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">To do this, go to the Settings tab in either of the editors
            and choose the 'launch offline' option. If you have already
            installed your app to your home screen, you will then need to
            uninstall and reinstall the app in order to launch it from the
            home screen icon. Otherwise you'll need to launch it from the
            AppSheet app itself.
