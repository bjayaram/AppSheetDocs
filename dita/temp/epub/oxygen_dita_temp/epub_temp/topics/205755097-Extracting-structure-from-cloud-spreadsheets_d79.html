      <div class="body">
         
         <p class="p">Most interesting apps show and capture data. Traditionally,
            apps built by software developers use proprietary mechanisms to
            store data in structured databases. AppSheet avoids this
            approach for two reasons: (1) <strong class="ph b">our app creators are not
               software developers</strong>, (2) <strong class="ph b">we want our app
               creators to be in full control of their data</strong>.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">Instead AppSheet apps use data from spreadsheets.
            Spreadsheets allow almost anyone to organize and store data. In
            later sections, we'll describe how you can also access data
            from other sources, but for now, let's focus on
            spreadsheets.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">AppSheet cannot access data from a spreadsheet on
               your PC</strong>, but it can access data from a spreadsheet
            stored in a cloud file system like Google Drive or Dropbox. To
            explain it really simply, AppSheet makes your cloud-hosted
            spreadsheet behave like a simple database. The power of using a
            cloud-hosted spreadsheet is that there are no copies of your
            data created, nor is the data 'uploaded' into AppSheet servers.
            Instead, AppSheet reads and writes directly to your
            spreadsheet.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">AppSheet automatically infers the structure of your data
            from the spreadsheet you provide. AppSheet models a data set as
            a 'table'-- i.e. a collection of rows with uniformly structured
            columns. Each spreadsheet is treated as a single 'table'.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">For each column, AppSheet infers a data type, such as text,
            number, date, etc. There are more than 20 data types
            recognized. AppSheet also automatically groups related columns
            to form composite columns-- eg: [FirstName and LastName], or
            [Street, City, State]. These inferences happen automatically
            but of course, they may not always make the right decision, so
            you can always override and fine tune these choices.
