      <h1 class="title topictitle1">Traditional vs. instant app deployment – AppSheet</h1>
      
      <div class="body">
         
         <p class="p">We do NOT follow the traditional app deployment model
            because it is too cumbersome.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">The traditional 'heavyweight' app deployment model is to
            create and submit each app separately to an app store (iTunes
            Store for iOS and Google Play Store for Android). And then your
            users find and download the app from the app store. This is
            mechanically complex-- a software developer needs to package
            code together and submit it. It is procedurally complex-- there
            are forms to fill out and an approval process. It is time
            consuming, especially as this is the process every time you
            make a small change to your app.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">These processes make sense if you are building a unique app
            for consumers or a broad audience. In the future, we may offer
            a 'whitelabel' service for this scenario, but it does not make
            sense if you are building an app for your team or employees.
            That's why we have created an instant app deployment
            mechanism for AppSheet. Deploying an AppSheet app is as simple
            as clicking on a link in an email and following a couple of
            instructions.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p"> </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">
            <span class="ph wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-color-black">
               <strong class="ph b">AppSheet's
                  deployment model</strong>
               </span>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">AppSheet runs on iOS and Android (4.2 and above)
            devices. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">Instant app deployment is possible because all
            AppSheet apps (the apps you build) are "hosted" by the AppSheet
            mobile app.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">The essential idea behind AppSheet is that your apps are
            driven by data and configuration settings. The only unique
            aspect of each app is its data and its configuration. And
            everything else that is _common_ across apps is collected
            together into a single 'hosting' environment called the
            AppSheet mobile app.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">The AppSheet app already available for download in each
            mobile appstore. When you deploy and run your app, it will
            appear to run on its own, but is actually 'hosted' by the
            AppSheet app. While this is not a perfectly accurate analogy,
            it may be useful to think of your app hosted in the
            AppSheet app in just the same way that web pages are
            hosted in a web browser.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">You can distribute your app <a href="unresolvable-reference.html" class="xref">by sending
               your users an install link by email</a>. When they click on the
            link from a mobile device, they are asked to install AppSheet
            on their device (AppSheet is already available in the app
            stores) and then to install the app icon on their homescreen.
            Clicking on the icon launches the app.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">Your app is hosted and rendered on the mobile device using
            AppSheet as a 'runtime', just the same way different web pages
            are hosted in a browser.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">Beyond the obvious simplicity of this approach, there are a
            few other benefits:
         </p>
         
         
         <ul class="ul">
            
            
            <li class="li">Your apps are instantly available-- there is no delay
               between app creation and app deployment.
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">Changes to your apps are instantly available too.</li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">Any system-wide changes (new features we provide, issues
               we fix, performance improvements) automatically appear in all
               apps.
            </li>
            
            
            
         </ul>
         
         
         <p class="p">In some cases, you might really want to build a traditional
            app like a software developer. White-label is a possibility for
            AppSheet apps, we are currently working on a solution for
            stand-alone apps that go in the store but the option is
            currently unavailable. While this choice is not common, you
            might consider it if:

         <ul class="ul">
            
            
            <li class="li">The discovery and distribution model of the appstore is
               important in your use case.
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">You are aiming for large scale consumer adoption of your
               app.
            </li>
            
            
            
         </ul>
         
         
         <p class="p">When you choose to submit an app to the iTunes or Google
            Play app stores, you need to ensure that it conforms to the
            policies of those app stores, and the approval process that
            goes along with it.
