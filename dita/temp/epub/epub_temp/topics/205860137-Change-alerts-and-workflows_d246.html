            You might want to take actions when data updates occur. Change workflows are the mechanism
            to do this. Change workflow rules (emails) fire at the AppSheet backend when data
            changes are made
            and synced through the AppSheet app running on the mobile device or the desktop browser.

            This feature set will grow further in functionality over time. The rules can be authored
            in the Advanced Editor&gt;Settings&gt;Content. Please note that while the app is in test
            mode (i.e.
            it has not passed a <a href="205803947-Check-your-app-for-deployment_d269.html" class="xref">Deployment Check</a>), any messages sent from workflow actions will go only to the app creator.

               <span class="ph wysiwyg-underline"></span>
               </strong>A workflow rule can be triggered when:
            
         </p>
         
         
         <ul class="ul">
            
            
            <li class="li">A new row is added to a table.
               
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">A row is updated in a table.
               
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">A row is deleted from a table.
               
            </li>
            
            
            
         </ul>
         
         
         <p class="p">
            You may wish to further restrict when a workflow rule is triggered. For example, maybe
            the workflow rule should only be triggered when a row is changed and the row satisfies
            a specific
            condition. For example:
            
         </p>
         
         
         <ul class="ul">
            
            
            <li class="li">When a new row is added to the Inspections table, and the value in the InspectionPassed
               field is false.
               
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">When a row is updated in the Orders slice, and the value in the OrderAmount field
               is over $500.
               
            </li>
            
            
            
         </ul>
         
         
         <p class="p">
            We enable this via slices. Typically, you define slices in order to show filtered
            views of the data. This is a very different use of slices. You can choose to trigger
            a rule only if the
            changed row is included in a slice. So in the first example above, you would define
            a slice that includes only rows where the InspectionPassed field is false. You would
            then configure
            your workflow rule to refer to this slice and only take effect when a row is added.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">
            Note that since you can specify multiple change actions and multiple tables or slices
            in each rule, it is a very powerful mechanism to specify the rule firing condition.

               </strong>The AppSheet workflow rules are evaluated on the AppSheet server when a user does
            an add,
            update, or delete through the AppSheet client and then syncs these changes back to
            the server. When the client syncs the changes to the server, the server first makes
            the appropriate changes
            to the spreadsheet and then checks whether any workflow rules should be invoked.
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">
            The AppSheet server invokes the workflow rule action if all of the following conditions
            are satisfied.
            
         </p>

            <li class="li">If workflow rules are specified for the table or slice, the server checks whether
               the workflow rule's "Update event" type matches the action the user performed, that
               is Add, Update, or
               Delete. 
               
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">Finally, if the workflow rule is specified for a Slice, the server checks whether
               the slice filter condition is true. The server skips this step, if the workflow rule
               is associated with
               a table rather than a slice.
               
            </li>

         <p class="p">
            Changes you make directly to the spreadsheet do not go through the AppSheet server,
            so they do not trigger the AppSheet workflow rules. For example, if you update a Google
            Sheet directly,
            Google Sheets does not notify the AppSheet server about the change, so the AppSheet
            server is completely unaware of the change. When your AppSheet client performs a sync,
            the AppSheet server
            will read the Google Sheet and return the updated data values to the client, but AppSheet
            server is unaware that you updated the Google Sheet directly.

               to the customer who
               created the order. You can do this by entering an expression specifying the field
               name containing the customer's email address. For example, if there is a field called
               "CustomerEmail"
               in the updated record, you can specify <strong class="ph b">[CustomerEmail]</strong> in the email address list.

               a
               reference to a Customer record. Each Customer record might contain the customer's
               email address. When a new order is captured, you can send email to the customer who

               can do this by entering the name of the Order record field that references the customer
               record, followed by the name of the Customer record field containing the customer's
               email address.
               For example, assume the name of the Order record field that references the customer
               record is <strong class="ph b">CustRef</strong>, Assume the name of the Customer record field containing the
               customer's email address is <strong class="ph b">CustEmail</strong>. You can specify the customer's email address by entering the expression <strong class="ph b">[CustRef].[CustEmail]</strong> in the email
