      <div class="body">
         
         <p class="p">As described earlier, Sync has three stages:</p>
         
         
         <ol class="ol">
            
            
            <li class="li">Send changes from the device to the backend.
               When this stage starts, the Sync progress bar is about
               1/4 complete.
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">Fetch the latest app definition from the backend. After
               this stage, the Sync progress bar moves to 3/4 complete.
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">Fetch the latest data from the backend.</li>
            
            
            
         </ol>
         
         
         <p class="p">Most errors in Sync are observed in the first stage (i.e.
            when the progress bar is 1/4 complete). 
         </p>
         
         
         <ol class="ol">
            
            
            <li class="li">If there are network errors, the step is retried a few
               times, and if the failure persists, the Sync is halted. The
               solution is to retry later when connectivity is
               better.
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">If you have poor connectivity or if large images have to
               be sent as part of the Sync, this step can take a long time
               and can potentially timeout. The solution is to retry later
               when connectivity is better.
            </li>
            
            
            
         </ol>
         
         
         <p class="p">If the app definition has changed on the backend (for
            example, new columns have been added to the data), the local
            changes from the device may no longer be executable. In this
            case, an error message is shown to the app user during Sync. It
            usually takes the form of an error indicating that a value
            being inserted is incompatible with the type of data expected
            (because the columns have changed!). If you use the advanced
            menu in the app (top left) and choose 'About', you will see the
            basic app information including the version number. The version
            number indicates the accurate version of the app that is being
            run. The creator of your app can look at the latest app version
            number via the app editor's Manage pane. This is the best way
            to determine if there is a mismatch between the app version on
            your device and the app version expected by the AppSheet
            backend during sync. There are two possible remedies to this
            situation:
         </p>
         
         
         <ol class="ol">
            
            
            <li class="li">Restore the old version: the app creator can restore the
               required version of the app. This will work only if the
               underlying data sources (spreadsheets) have not changed their
               column structure. Once the old version is restored, the sync
               should proceed successfully.
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">Manual recovery: if all else fails, you will have to
               abandon the changes on the device via "Reset Changes" (in the
               advanced menu at the top left of the app). However if you
               cannot afford to lose these local changes, first click on the
               "Show Changes" menu option. This will give you the
               option to send yourself a copy of the changes via email, so
               that you can manually process this data.
