         <p class="p">Lots of customer ask for the ability to create monotonically
            increasing record number keys that accurately reflects the
            order in which the records were created. This is a natural
            desire, but it is technically impossible in a system that
            combines multiple distributed clients, who are allowed to
            concurrently add records, and who can add records while
            offline.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">It is possible, but can be expensive, if you are willing to
            relax one or more of these requirements.
            
            1. Monotonically increasing key, such as 1, 2, 3 ... or 1000,
            1001, 1002, ...
            2. Keys accurately reflect the order the records were first
            created by the client.
            3. Two or more clients can add records concurrently.
            4. Clients can add records while offline.
            
            For example, you can achieve a monotonically increasing key
            through a central locking scheme if you are willing to give up
            doing adds while offline.  
            
            If you are willing to give up having the record number increase
            strictly monotonically and to reflect the exact order the
            records were created, you can give each client a
            block of numbers that only that client uses for its newly added
            record key values. The block of numbers reserved for each
            client must be large enough so that no client runs out of
            preassigned numbers while it is working offline. Obviously, the
            record number keys are no longer strictly monotonically
            increasing and they don't strictly reflect the order of
            creation, but they roughly reflect the order the records were
            added.
            
            You can assign monotonically increasing number keys to newly
            added records, by having the server assign the record number
            keys after the client synchronizes. The resulting record number
            keys reflect the order in which the newly added record first
            reached the server, rather than the absolute time they were
            created by each client. This can lead to some complications
            because the client only knows the record's "real
            key" after it synchronizes with the server. If the client
            adds a set of records that are related by key value, the client
            must assign the actual key values to each of the newly created
            records, and ensure they the references between these records
            reflect the actual key values. The client can only do this
            after the actual key values are returned by the server.
            
            There are other design alternatives, but all of them involve
            tradeoffs regarding which requirements you relax and how much
            cost you are willing to bear to achieve nearly monotonically
            increasing record number keys.
