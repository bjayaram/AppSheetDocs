         <p class="p">AppSheet is a subscription service.</p>
         
         
         <p class="p">We have structured our plans and pricing to encourage
            adoption with minimal friction and barriers to use. If none of
            our plans are appropriate for your scenario, we encourage you
            to contact us.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">By default, every user account is free until a specific
            subscription plan is chosen. Please review the list of
            available plans at our <a href="http://www.appsheet.com/home/pricing.html" class="xref">Pricing

         <p class="p">AppSheet is free only for prototyping and for personal
            projects. While you are evaluating AppSheet, you are not
            required to pay as you evaluate all of the platform features.
            In fact, we encourage you to try all the features of the
            platform. However, as you deploy your apps to others and start
            to use them in your organization, you should change your
            account to a paid plan. When you take your app through the
            'Deploy Check' process, you will be warned if your account is
            not on a paid plan and that is the preferred stage at which to
            sign up for a paid plan. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Per-user Plans</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">When you build apps for users within your organization, you
            probably need to identify specific people who will use the app
            (perhaps members of your team or department). This is an ideal
            case for a per-user subscription plan. In a per-user plan, you
            purchase licenses for every user of your apps. Each licensed
            user can use many of your apps. So for example, if there are
            ten people in your team, you should purchase ten licenses and
            you can create one app, two apps, or any number of apps that
            are used by these users.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Per-app plans</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">If you build apps to send to a large base of occasional
            users (for example, for a community event, or to share your
            product catalog with your customers), a per-app subscription
            plan is probably appropriate. Per-app plans differ from
            per-user plans in that you cannot limit the app to specific
            users. They are meant for situations where data security is not
            a concern. In a per-app plan, you purchase licenses for each
            deployable app in your account. So for example, if you had two
            apps that you want to deploy widely, you would purchase two app
            licenses.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p"> </p>

         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">Each AppSheet account has a single subscription plan. It is
            not possible to have some apps in an account associated with
            one plan and other apps associated with a different plan. We
            recognize though that this is a requirement for some of our
            customers and will release updates to accommodate such need.
            For now, you can create additional AppSheet accounts to add
            apps to a different type of plan.

         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">You can change your subscription plan or the number of
            licenses on your plan at any time. Your charges are immediately
            applied and any charges are pro-rated to reflect the
            changes.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">For example, assume you have five users of your app and have
            purchased five user licenses with a per-user plan. If you need
            to send the app to more users, you should simply increase the
            number of licenses via the Billing tab on your account page.
            Likewise, you can decrease the number of licenses to reflect
            lower expected usage or change plans.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">It is uncommon to switch from a paid subscription plan to no
            plan unless you expect your apps to see absolutely no usage at
            all. It is usually more appropriate to modify the number of
            licenses to reflect periods of lower expected usage. 
         </p>

         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">We try to ensure that app usage is never compromised because
            of short-term discrepancies in plans and licenses. If the
            actual number of users for your app crosses your license
            limits, we will still serve the app to those users. Likewise,
            if you are on the wrong plan or there is a problem with your
            credit card, we will continue to serve the app to your users.
            In both cases, we do this for a reasonable interval so that you
            have the time to modify your plan appropriately.

         <p class="p">You may choose and adjust your Subscription plan until
            you are confident that you have selected the correct plan for
            you or your business. Next, enter your Payment Method. Your
            credit card is charged on a monthly schedule based on the
            particular plan and license count you have chosen. AppSheet
            processes credit card payments through Stripe, a popular and
            reliable platform for credit card payments.

         <p class="p">If you make changes in the middle of the month, the pricing
            is pro-rated to the time of the change. You may see adjustments
            to the next month's billing to reflect these changes. For
            example, if you lower the number of licenses, you will see
            credit reflected in your next month's bill. Please contact us
            at any time if you have questions about your
            billing.

         <p class="p">As a paid subscriber, you get a monthly email with a summary

            individual invoices other than the emails sent to you directly
            from Stripe. Large Accounts may contact us directly for

         <p class="p">Our credit-card charges are USD-based, and cards based in
            countries outside the US may have security constraints that
