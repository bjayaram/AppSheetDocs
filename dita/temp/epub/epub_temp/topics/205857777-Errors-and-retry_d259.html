      <div class="body">
         
         <p class="p">Mobile apps must account for failure to send updates to the
            backend. There are multiple reasons for failure:
         </p>
         
         
         <ul class="ul">
            
            
            <li class="li">Your mobile device may have connectivity issues.</li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">We hate to say this, but AppSheet's servers could have
               occasional connectivity or downtime issues.
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">Your cloud file system (eg: Google Drive) can have
               occasional connectivity or downtime issues.
            </li>
            
            
            
         </ul>
         
         
         <p class="p">These are the realities of working in a mobile-to-cloud
            environment where changes from the app have to be recorded at
            the backend cloud service. Yet any data captured by the app
            should never be lost.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">AppSheet accomplishes this using three basic mechanisms
            (none of which you need to do anything to configure-- it just
            happens automatically):
         </p>
         
         
         <ol class="ol">
            
            
            <li class="li">All changes are recorded locally on the device. Even if
               the device shuts down and restarts, the changes are still
               available. Of course, if the device is lost or destroyed
               before you sync, those changes are gone forever.
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">When data is synced from the app, it travels to the
               AppSheet backend, and then on to the backend spreadsheet, and
               then the acknowledgment of success has to flow back all the
               way to the mobile app. If this does not happen in a timely
               fashion, the user sees an error message. Importantly, the
               change is queued up for a subsequent retry. If the user syncs
               again, the change gets sent again.
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">Of course, now we could have the situation where the same
               change is attempted multiple times (because perhaps the
               success acknowledgment failed to reach the app, though the
               update was successfully applied). All AppSheet updates are
               designed to be 'idempotent'-- i.e. you can apply them
               repeatedly without a change in behavior.
            </li>
            
            
            
         </ol>
         
         
         <p class="p">There is one other situation where errors occur-- when the
            app creator changes the app definition by adding or removing
            columns, but some user of the app still has the old version of
            the app and has unsynced updates on that app. Unfortunately,
            when there is a structure mismatch between the updates and the
            app definition, the updates fail. Retries will continue to
            fail. More details on handling this situation are provided
