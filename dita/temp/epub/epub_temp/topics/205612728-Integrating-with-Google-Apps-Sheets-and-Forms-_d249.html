         <p class="p">Google Sheets allow you to create onEdit triggers--
            these are code functions that will run whenever a Google Sheet
            is edited via Google's web interface. However, these onEdit
            triggers do not fire when data is edited and synced to the
            spreadsheet via AppSheet. If you have important functionality
            that needs to run on updated data, we suggest moving it to a
            timed trigger (a different kind of trigger that Google
            supports). You can learn more about these different trigger
            types via the Google Docs page.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">Also, do not use filters on your Google Sheets --- it can
            make the filtered rows invisible to updates. Instead, use
            filter views (this is a Google Sheets feature that lets each
            user create and use their own filters without affecting other
            users of the sheet).

         <ol class="ol">
            
            
            <li class="li">
               <strong class="ph b">Prepare</strong>: this analyzes the form, takes
               information from the form questions and adds it to the
               response spreadsheet in the form of notes on the column
               headers
            </li>

         </ol>
         
         
         <p class="p">It is important to understand that the AppSheet service
            cannot access the form itself directly-- it is only the add-on
            (a web component running in your browser) that can access the
            form. This is why the Prepare step is important.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">This process has a few important caveats and
            limitations that you should be aware of:

         <p class="p">If you add new questions or move questions around, the order
            of columns in the response spreadsheet may no longer correspond
            to the latest form content. You will need to create a new
            response spreadsheet (via the Responses menu), Prepare, and
            then Launch again.

            <strong class="ph b">Choosing AppSheet types</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">You may want to use <a href="http://205856187-Column-types.dita" class="xref">AppSheet input
               types</a> like Photos, Signatures, etc. Those cannot be
            specified in a Google Form. So what can you do? The simple
            approach is to specify a question as being of Text type and use
            a question title that is suggestive of the type (eg" Customer
            Photo") or ("Manager Signature"), etc. AppSheet tries to
            automatically guess the type based on these titles. You can
            also change the type yourself in the Data / Column
            Structure tab of the AppSheet <a href="http://206559378-Advanced-app-customizations.dita" class="xref">Advanced Editor</a>.

         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">Google Forms can contain embedded images and videos.
            Although AppSheet forms can as well, the Forms add-on is unable
            to extract embedded image and video data during the automatic
            app creation process. These fields will be given placeholder
            URLs in the generated app that you should update in the
            AppSheet <a href="http://206559378-Advanced-app-customizations.dita" class="xref">Advanced Editor</a> with correct URLs
            pointing to your image or video content.

         <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Form navigation</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">Google Forms has a powerful mechanism to chain
            sections together using a "go-to-next"
            navigation model tied to answers of specific
            questions. At the end of every section, you can also specify
            to jump to another section or submit the
            form. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">AppSheet uses a different mechanism. In AppSheet, you
            can specify a conditional expression that controls whether or
            not a form page should be shown. The Forms add-on attempts to
            automatically generate the appropriate expressions
            based on the structure of your form.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">Most forms can now be correctly converted to AppSheet apps
            automatically, but there are three main limitations:
         </p>
         
         
         <ol class="ol">
            
            
            <li class="li">Reverse navigation is not supported by AppSheet.
               Try to arrange your form such that all navigation proceeds to
               higher section numbers.
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">In Google Forms you can
               include a special "Other" option for
               Multiple choice questions and assign it specific navigation
               behavior. However, the navigation associated with this choice
               is not made available to the AppSheet add-on. We
               recommend avoiding use of "Other" on questions
               where "Go to section based on answer" is
               enabled.
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">There is a practical limit to how much branching
               navigation can occur in a single form. Part of the process of
               converting to AppSheet's "Show If" navigation model requires
               building the set of all distinct paths through the
               form. The total number of paths through a
               form can quickly become unmanageable when there
               are many sections with redundant navigation options, such as
               multiple questions in the
               same section that can send the user to the
               same place. For this reason <strong class="ph b">we
                  strongly recommend using at most one navigating
                  question per section, and marking these required
                  whenever possible</strong>. Note that when more than one
               navigating question occurs in one section of a Google Form,
               only the last answered question will affect navigation
               anyway, and any others will be ignored.

         <p class="p">Questions in Google Forms have Advanced options that let you
            constrain the type of the response. This information is
            unfortunately not made available to the add-on. However,

         <p class="p">Google Forms has a convenient feature that shows a
            statistical distribution of responses. Unfortunately, this does
            not capture responses made via the AppSheet app-- although the
            underlying response spreadsheet has all the responses, the
            statistics are only measured on changes made through the Google
            Form itself. However, Google Sheets now has a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB8QFjAAahUKEwjaz8Hkv-_HAhWLOYgKHe0mARU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.google.com%2Fdocs%2Fanswer%2F6280499%3Fhl%3Den&amp;usg=AFQjCNFqP92py3USUhu-2hodBYBZXvEmGg.html" class="xref">
               great new feature</a> that serves a similar purpose --- it is
            called "Explore" and is found via a plus button at the bottom
            right of the Google Sheet. Click on the Explore button in your
            response sheet to automatically get insights into your form
            responses.

         <p class="p">In a Google Form, you have an option at the top to collect
            the username (actually the user email) of the respondent. This
            causes an extra column 'Username' to be added to the response
            spreadsheet. Unfortunately, this column may be placed at any
            position within the spreadsheet and messes up the AppSheet
            service. We recommend therefore that if you want this
            capability, enable this option at the very end after completing
            the authoring of the rest of the form. This adds the Username
            column at the end and therefore does not cause any issues.

            not fire when updates are made via AppSheet. As with onEdit
            triggers, we recommend moving this logic to a timed
