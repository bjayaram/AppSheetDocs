      <div class="body">
         
         <p class="p">The mobile app that you build communicates with the AppSheet
            backend, and it is the AppSheet backend that communicates with
            your cloud data provider (eg: Google Drive) to fetch or
            update data.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">For security reasons, the cloud data provider will not let
            AppSheet access your data unless AppSheet has the permissions
            to do so. Whenever a user or app creator signs in,
            he/she grants AppSheet the permission to act on their
            behalf.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p"> </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">As app creator</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">In the default run mode ('as app creator'), the AppSheet
            backend accesses data with the identity of the app creator. So
            if you are the app creator, and you have access to the
            spreadsheet that the app is based on, you can distribute your
            app to other people who do not have direct access to that data
            but the app still works fine.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">There is a security setting in the Advanced Editor which
            allows you to change the run mode to 'as app user'. As the name
            suggests, in this mode, the AppSheet backend will try to access
            the app data with the identity of the app user. This will fail
            for apps that don't enforce sign in. And even if the user does
            sign into the app, it may still fail if the user doesn't have
            permissions to access the source spreadsheet and folder.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p"> </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">As app user</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">So what's the benefit of the 'as app user' run mode? It is a
            stricter security mechanism (ensures that the permissions model
            of the cloud data provider are strictly maintained). It is also
            an auditing mechanism, especially for cloud providers like
            Google Drive and Box that maintain audit histories of all
            updates made to documents. If the app runs 'as app user', each
            change to the app recorded in the audit history will carry the
            identity of the specific user who made the change. Please be
            aware that if the app user does not have permissions to access
            the underlying data (eg: the spreadsheet on Google Drive that
            holds the app's data), the app will fail for that user.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">To avoid any confusion, this option has no bearing on the
            mode in which the app itself runs on the mobile device. The
            user who signs in is always the current user and expressions
            like @(_USERNAME) and @(_USEREMAIL) always reflect the current
            signed-in user, never the app creator.
         </p>
