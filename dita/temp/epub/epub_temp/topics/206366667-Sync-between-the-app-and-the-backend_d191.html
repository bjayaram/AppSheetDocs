      <h1 class="title topictitle1">Sync-- between the app and the backend – AppSheet</h1>
      
      <div class="body">
         
         <p class="p">Apps built with AppSheet are designed to handle intermittent
            connectivity loss, or full offline operation. This is achieved
            by maintaining a copy of the relevant data locally on the
            mobile device (securely, of course!). As a side-effect of this
            design, we have to consider when and how the local copy of the
            data stays in sync with the backend spreadsheet.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">There are three cases to consider:</p>
         
         
         <ol class="ol">
            
            
            <li class="li">Changes are made in the app and need to be propagated to
               the backend.
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">Changes are made to the backend data (either directly, or
               by other users of the AppSheet app) and these need to be
               propagated to the app.
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">Changes are made to the app definition itself and need to
               be propagated to the app.
            </li>
            
            
            
         </ol>
         
         
         <p class="p">All of these occur as part of "Sync". There are four ways in
            which Sync may be invoked:
         </p>
         
         
         <ol class="ol">
            
            
            <li class="li">If this is the first time the app is being invoked on a
               specific device, Sync is automatically invoked when the app
               is started. This fetches the latest app definition along with
               the data needed to run the app.
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">For apps that work primarily online and want close to
               synchronous behavior, the app creator should disable the
               "Delayed Sync" setting. Every time the app user saves any
               edit, add, or delete action, this not only makes the change
               locally on the device but also immediately invokes Sync.
               
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">If the app has local changes that have not been
               propagated to the backend, the Sync button (at the bottom
               right) is highlighted. Clicking on Sync will manually invoke
               the Sync function. For apps that work primarily
               offline, the app creator should enable the "<a href="unresolvable-reference.html" class="xref">Delayed
                  Sync</a>" setting, and the app users will explicitly invoke
               Sync when they have network connectivity.
               
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">The app creator can also enable the "Sync on Start"
               option. When this is enabled, the app syncs every time it is
               started by the user.
            </li>
            
            
            
         </ol>
         
         
         <p class="p">Each Sync action itself has three steps that occur
            sequentially:
         </p>
         
         
         <ol class="ol">
            
            
            <li class="li">Any local changes are sent to the backend and applied to
               the backend data in the order they were originally
               executed.
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">The latest app definition is fetched down to the mobile
               device. If no change has occurred since the last Sync, this
               step is optimized.
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">The latest backend data is fetched down to the mobile
