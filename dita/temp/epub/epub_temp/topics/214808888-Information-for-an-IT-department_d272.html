         <p class="p">If you are an AppSheet innovator at a larger company with an
            IT department, you may need to provide some
            information about AppSheet as you progress
            towards deploying your apps to others within the company.
            In this document, we've put together an "FAQ for IT".
            Many of the topics have more detailed information via separate
            articles in our Zendesk documentation site.

                  Architecture questions
                  </span>How are AppSheet apps created?</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">Apps are created on the AppSheet website. Each app is based
            on one or more 'tables'. Typically each table is a spreadsheet,
            but in general, each table is linked to a source of <a href="205096958-Mobile-apps-driven-by-the-structure-of-data_d80.html" class="xref">structured
               data</a>. The rest of the app is defined via configuration
            options. There is no code involved, so apps can be created in
            minutes.
            
            <strong class="ph b">How are AppSheet apps distributed?</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">Apps are distributed by sending an <a href="205803897-Sharing-and-distributing-your-app_d274.html" class="xref">install
               email to desired users with an install link</a>. Users open the
            install email on a mobile device, click on the install link,
            and can install the apps instantly. 
            
            <strong class="ph b">What is the high-level architecture of
               AppSheet?</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">Each mobile app is derived from and based on backend data,
            typically a spreadsheet hosted on a cloud storage system like
            Google Drive, Dropbox, or Office365. On the mobile device, a
            copy of the data is cached locally, in order to permit offline
            operation. Whenever changes are made in the app, or when the
            users explicitly choose to sync the app, the <a href="206366667-Sync-between-the-app-and-the-backend_d191.html" class="xref">changes
               from the app are moved to the backend spreadsheet, and vice
               versa</a>. All communication between the app and the backend
            data happens through the cloud-hosted AppSheet web service.
            
            <strong class="ph b">Where is AppSheet hosted?</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">AppSheet's web service is hosted on Microsoft's Azure web
            hosting infrastructure.
            
            <strong class="ph b">Can AppSheet be hosted on-premise within the
               company?</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">No, AppSheet is hosted in the cloud. It is not an on-premise
            service.
            
            <strong class="ph b">Is AppSheet reliable?</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">The AppSheet web service is highly reliable with
            99.99% monthly uptime. The reliability derives from both the
            redundant cloud architecture as well as the reliability of the
            underlying cloud infrastructure services like Microsoft Azure.
            The greatest source of reliability concerns for a mobile app
            stem from <a href="205096588-What-if-I-lose-connectivity-_d258.html" class="xref">connectivity
               issues</a>. AppSheet is explicitly designed for environments
            with bad or intermittent connectivity, and the data
            synchronization technology handles various kinds of failures
            seamlessly without data loss.
            
            <strong class="ph b">Is each app separately deployed via the iOS or Android
               app store?</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">No. Mobile apps run on the device within a common 'host' app
            called AppSheet. This host app is already available in the iOS
            and Android app stores. This allows any new app to be <a href="205111288-Traditional-vs-instant-app-deployment_d81.html" class="xref">instantly
               deployable</a>.
         </p>

                  Data architecture questions
                  </span>What sources of data can AppSheet
               access?</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">AppSheet apps can access spreadsheet data from Google Drive,
            Office365, Dropbox, Box, and Smartsheet. More data sources are
            being added actively. Connectors to Salesforce and SQL
            databases will shortly be available for early
            adopters. 
            
            <strong class="ph b">Do we <em class="ph i">have</em> to use data in a
               spreadsheet?</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">AppSheet is meant for non-developers to easily build apps,
            which is why we have emphasized access to spreadsheets. Over
            the next few months, we will also be supporting more
            traditional enterprise data sources as well.
            
            <strong class="ph b">Can you connect to our corporate database or resources
               behind a firewall?</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">Not directly. The AppSheet architecture permits our service
            to interact with data sources via a web service that acts as a
            proxy to the actual data. If the actual data is behind a
            firewall, you (or your IT department) will need to create a web
            service that acts as a proxy for the data. This is a relatively
            straightforward task for a web developer and we can
            help enterprise customers with sample code for this
            proxy service.

         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">AppSheet apps run on iOS and Android devices. We encourage
            iOS version 8.0 and higher, and Android version 4.3 and higher.
            Lower versions of these operating systems can cause subtle bugs
            or performance problems in certain scenarios. 
            
            <strong class="ph b">Can the apps run in a browser?</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">Yes. While we primarily focus on mobile devices, many
            AppSheet customers also run their apps in a web browser,
            usually within an iframe. In fact, on unsupported mobile
            platforms like Windows Phone, we recommend running within a
            browser. Most of the app functionality is supported in a
            browser (except offline image caching and bar code scanning).
            We recommend a modern browser and the apps work best on Chrome.
            AppSheet does not work on IE versions lower than V10.0.

            uncommon for us to unblock a customer by adding a new feature
            in a couple of weeks. There is an active <a href="http://community.appsheet.com.html" class="xref">user community</a> that
            drives and prioritizes our feature investments. All features
            are initially announced via the community for trial and then

         <p class="p">The AppSheet service records user signup information and
            access tokens in order to be able to access backend spreadsheet
            data. The definition of each app is also stored. <a href="205176168-Where-is-my-data-cached-_d256.html" class="xref">The actual data used
               by each app is not copied to the AppSheet service</a>-- instead
            it passes through the AppSheet service as it flows between the
            mobile device and the backend cloud storage system chosen by
            the customer. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">AppSheet does record usage events and also logs data updates
            in order to support diagnostics, debugging, analytics, and
            billing. We are introducing an option for customers to limit
            the duration for which this information stays in the system
