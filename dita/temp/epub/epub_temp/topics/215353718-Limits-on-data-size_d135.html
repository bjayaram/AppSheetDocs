      <div class="body">
         
         <p class="p">AppSheet is meant for mobile apps that are designed to work
            seamlessly despite intermittent connectivity or completely
            offline. As a result, all data used by the app must be cached
            locally on the mobile device. This is an important factor
            to consider when designing your app. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">Ideally, you should make your data set as small as possible
            to achieve the desired functionality.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p"> </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Actual limits</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">Do not build an AppSheet app against a huge data set.
            What is "huge"? For an AppSheet app, the compressed data size
            limit is 5MB or 10MB (depending on the device) for all the data
            in one app. It is difficult to translate this accurately into a
            specific number of rows or columns because compressed data size
            depends on how much repetition there is in the data. For
            example, a large spreadsheet with a lot of empty cells will
            probably compress better than a smaller spreadsheet with no
            empty cells. In general, the fewer cells in the sheet,
            the better.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">In the future, we may increase the 5MB/10MB limit.</p>
         
         
         <p class="p">"External" data like images and documents are not included
            in this data size limit. You can definitely have applications
            with many rows and an image in every row. Images and documents
            are not cached locally on the device by default. If you do
            enable the option to cache images for offline access, they are
            stored in a different location on the device that does not have
            the same size limitations.

            <strong class="ph b">Performance concerns</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">In practice today, this is not a meaningful limit, because
            system performance degrades well before you reach the limit.
            This happens for three reasons:
         </p>
         
         
         <ol class="ol">
            
            
            <li class="li">Slow iterative development-- the data set is checked
               repeatedly during app development to ensure that the app is
               consistent with the data
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">Long sync times-- when data is synchronized between the
               device and the backend, the delay depends on the size of the
               data set. 
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">Sluggish app behavior-- large data sets can make the app
               itself sluggish in its interactions like scrolling, search,
               etc.
            </li>
            
            
            
         </ol>
         
         
         <p class="p"> </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">
            <strong class="ph b">Mitigations</strong>
            
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">Always check if your sheets have empty rows in them. In
            particular, some sheets have hundreds of empty rows at the
            bottom. Removing these rows will improve performance.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">Also check if your sheets have many extra worksheets that
            are not being used by the app at all. Removing extra worksheets
            will improve performance.
         </p>
         
         
         <p class="p">In some circumstances though, the underlying dataset is
            large and just cannot be changed. If so, consider using either
            of these options:
         </p>
         
         
         <ol class="ol">
            
            
            <li class="li">Use a Security Filter to forcibly limit the data sent to
               the mobile app.
            </li>
            
            
            
            <li class="li">use a slice to subset the data and strictly use
               only the slice in your app. This allows AppSheet to send just
               that subset of data to the device.
            </li>
            
            
            
         </ol>
         
         
         <p class="p">It is often the case that even if an app requires large data
            sets, much of the data is read-only. In this situation, you can
            improve some aspects of app performance by separating the
            read-only data sets into a separate table or tables from those
            that are writeable/updateable.
