   <title>Multiple data sources â€“ AppSheet</title>
   <body>
      <p>Your AppSheet apps can access data from multiple data
    sources. The AppSheet account always has a primary data source
    used for account authentication (for many of our customers,
    this is Google Drive) and the spreadsheets from that account
    can be used in your apps. However, you can add other data
    sources (eg: Office 365, Smartsheet, Dropbox, Box, and
    more).</p>
      <p>To add a new data source, go to your Account tab where you
    can examine your current data sources and add or remove
    sources. Adding a source is as simple as providing
    authentication.

    All the data sources in your account are available when you add
    tables to your AppSheet app. In fact, the same app can combine
    tables from multiple data sources. This becomes a really
    powerful mechanism to "mashup" information sitting in different
    cloud-based data sources.</p>
