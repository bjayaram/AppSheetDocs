   <title>App formulas â€“ AppSheet</title>
   <body>
      <p>Sometimes, you want calculations to run in the app while the
    user is interacting with the data. To help you achieve that
    goal, you can specify an App Formula for every column. An App
    Formula is an expression that AppSheet evaluates whenever
    a user changes a value in a form (while creating a new record
    or editing an existing record). Each time such a change occurs,
    the App Formula of every column in the record is evaluated and
    the column is assigned the result of the formula evaluation.
    For example, if a record has a Price column and a Tax column,
    the Tax column might have an App Formula [Price]*0.05 to
    compute a 5% tax automatically. </p>
      <p>In AppSheet's Advanced Editor, you can add App Formulas to
    any column when you go to Data&gt;Column Structure.</p>

      <p>Click on the edit icon (seen above) and navigate to
    the App Formula field to enter the formula you need for your
    app. The formula itself is any valid AppSheet expression that
    matches the type of the column. You can learn more about
    <xref href="211326838-Expressions.dita">the different kinds of
    expressions</xref> supported by AppSheet.</p>
      <p>App Formulas are distinct from  <xref href="206199518-Spreadsheet-formulas.dita">Spreadsheet Formulas</xref>.
    The two mechanisms are complementary and both add value
    to your app. Your spreadsheet is a very powerful tool to
    run calculations. Those calculations run only when
    data syncs back to the spreadsheet. </p>
      <p>App Formulas are commonly used to calculate the value of a
    column when the user makes updates to the app. When the changes
    are synced back to the spreadsheet, the computed value is saved
    to the corresponding spreadsheet cell.</p>
      <p>App Formulas are also used to define <xref href="212081828-Virtual-Columns.dita">Virtual Columns</xref>. These
    columns do not actually exist in the spreadsheet but are only
    computed within the context of the app itself.</p>
