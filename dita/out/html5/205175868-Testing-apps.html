      <p class="p">During the app creation process, you may want to familiarize
    yourself with AppSheet's app building platform and all of the
    features it offers. Our goal is for you to be confident in the
    apps you create, the features they use, and their intended
    functionality before you decide which pricing plan fits your
    needs.</p>

      <p class="p">For these reasons, testing and prototyping apps are always
    free on AppSheet. You will not be restricted from using certain
    features that may otherwise be covered under paid plans if you
    are simply testing your apps and making sure they are ready to
    launch and deploy. Once you are confident your app runs as
    intended, and you know how many people will likely be using it,
    you can then decide which pricing plan is right for you.</p>
