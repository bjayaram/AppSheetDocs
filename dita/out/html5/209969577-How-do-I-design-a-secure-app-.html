   <div class="body">
      <p class="p">Apps created with AppSheet are secure because of the
    architecture of AppSheet, because of the underlying security
    infrastructure of cloud and mobile technology, and
    because of security options in your control. </p>

      <p class="p">First, let's quickly summarize the AppSheet architecture
    from a security point of view:</p>

      <ul class="ul">
      
         <li class="li">      
            <strong class="ph b">Cloud
      data:</strong> Your data is stored in your cloud data
      provider (Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, Smartsheet, Office365,
      etc). AppSheet does not store your data.</li>

      
         <li class="li">
        
            <strong class="ph b">     
        Authorization:</strong> 
            <a class="xref" href="205091758-Understanding-authentication-and-authorization.html">As
        explained in another section</a>, when creating an
        application, you sign into AppSheet with your cloud storage
        account and give AppSheet the permission to read and write
        your cloud storage data on your behalf. The industry
        standard OAuth protocol is used in this process.
      </li>

      
         <li class="li">      
            <strong class="ph b">Apps get built based on
      the cloud data: </strong> The application you create is
      saved to an application definition that is maintained
      by AppSheet in a secure cloud database. Communication between
      the AppSheet cloud service and your cloud storage provider
      uses secure web protocols (HTTPS).</li>

      
         <li class="li">      
            <strong class="ph b">The
      apps run on a mobile device:</strong> Communication
      between the mobile device and the AppSheet cloud service uses
      secure web protocols (HTTPS).</li>

      
         <li class="li">      
            <strong class="ph b">Local data
      storage:</strong> The application definition and all
      the necessary data is copied to the mobile device and
      securely stored locally on the device using HTML5 local
      storage.</li>

      
         <li class="li">      
            <strong class="ph b">Data synchronization:
       </strong>When you add, update, or delete data via the
      AppSheet application running on your mobile device,
      all changes you make are saved to your cloud data
      provider. The AppSheet cloud service acts as a go-between to
      connect the mobile app with the cloud data provider used by
      your app.</li>

    
      </ul>

      <p class="p">You may have the following security questions about each of
    these aspects of AppSheet-- we answer each of them in this
    article:</p>

      <ul class="ul">
      
         <li class="li">
            <strong class="ph b">      Who can
      access my cloud data directly?</strong>
         </li>

      
         <li class="li">
            <strong class="ph b">      Who can
      access my app and how do I control that?</strong>
         </li>

      
         <li class="li">
            <strong class="ph b">      Do the
      users of my app also need to have access to my spreadsheet in
      cloud storage?</strong>
         </li>

      
         <li class="li">
            <strong class="ph b">      What
      can users do with my app? Can they delete my
      data? </strong>
         </li>

      
         <li class="li">
            <strong class="ph b">      Can I
      limit the data that specific users of the app can
      see?</strong>
         </li>

      
         <li class="li">
            <strong class="ph b">      Can I
      limit the actions or capabilities that specific users of the
      app can do?</strong>
         </li>

      
         <li class="li">
            <strong class="ph b">      Who can
      access the data on the mobile device? </strong>
         </li>

      
         <li class="li">
            <strong class="ph b">      What
      happens if an app user leaves my organization and I want them
      to stop using my app?</strong>
         </li>

    
      </ul>

      <p class="p">I will explain these topics using a fictional app
    created by a teacher to distribute and collect
    assignments from her students in a graphic design class.
    </p>

      <p class="p">
         <strong class="ph b">
            <span class="ph wysiwyg-font-size-large">Who can access
    my cloud data directly?</span>
         </strong>
      </p>

      <p class="p">No other AppSheet user can access your cloud data
    directly-- that permission lives solely with you (and whoever
    else has your cloud account's login info). </p>

      <p class="p">Depending on the update permissions you have enabled in the
    app, the users of your app may be able to add, edit, or delete
    values that live in your cloud-hosted spreadsheets and that are
    exposed via the apps you build with AppSheet. You can control
    these permissions as described later in this article.</p>

      <p class="p">The AppSheet cloud service has permissions to act on your
    behalf to read and write your cloud data. These permissions are
    only used for the specific purposes of app creation and app
    execution. AppSheet does not save copies of your data.
    Furthermore, because of the way the OAuth protocol works, you
    can at any time decide to disable the access permissions
    granted to AppSheet.  </p>

      <p class="p">
         <span class="ph wysiwyg-font-size-large">
            <strong class="ph b">
    Who can access my app and how do I control
    that?</strong>
         </span>
      </p>

      <p class="p">You probably want to control who has access to your app--
    I'll use the <a class="xref" href="https://www.appsheet.com/samples/An-app-for-a-teacher-to-distribute-and-collect-class-assignments-?appGuidString=f6df29a2-b057-483e-986d-c676914f3b6a.html" target="_blank">
    Class Assignments</a> app to show how to
    do this. I want to ensure that only authorized
    students from my school can download and use the app. I can do
    this from the Advanced Editor&gt;Settings&gt;Security pane,
    by clicking the Require User Authentication
    checkbox:</p>

      <p class="p">
         <img class="image" src="../appsheethelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/205040847/Screen_Shot_2016-01-22_at_4.02.24_PM.png" alt="">
      </p>

      <p class="p">
    The whitelist is a list of users or a full domain you have
    permitted to access the app. You'll see that I've added a
    full domain (in this case, all students with a
    @sample.com subdomain), as well as a message that is
    included in the install link email that is sent when I click
    add. <strong class="ph b">
            <strong class="ph b"></strong>
         </strong>
      </p>

      <p class="p">AppSheet does not maintain its own user registry with
    usernames and passwords. Instead, your users will sign in using
    a standard cloud provider such as Google, Dropbox, Office365,
    Box, or Smartsheet. By default, we assume that your users will
    sign in using the same cloud provider that you use for your
    cloud storage. For example, if you use Google Drive, your app
    will be configured to ask your users to sign in with their
    Google accounts. AppSheet matches the email address of the
    application user's Google account with the list of allowed
    email addresses you specify in the white list. The user
    is permitted to use your app if the user's email address
    appears in the white
    list.<strong class="ph b">
            <strong class="ph b"></strong>
         </strong>
      </p>

      <p class="p">If you wish, your can require users to
    sign in using a different cloud provider that you use
    for your cloud storage. For example, you might
    require your users to sign in via Dropbox even
    though you use Google as your cloud storage provider. You
    can specify the sign in provider using the Advanced Editor.
    Open the Advanced Editor, select the "Settings" tab, select the
    "Security" tab, and select the appropriate authentication
    provider from the "Authentication Provider" drop down list.</p>

      <p class="p">If you wish, you can allow users to sign in using any of
    the cloud providers. For example, you may wish to allow
    users to sign in using either Google, Office365, or Smartsheet.
    To do this, open the Advanced Editor, select the "Settings"
    tab, select the "Security" tab, and select the
    blank authentication provider appearing at the top
    of "Authentication Provider" drop down list. This will
    enable your users to sign in with any of the standard
    cloud provider including Google, Dropbox, Office365, Box,
    and Smartsheet.
    </p>

      <p class="p">
    In the rest of this article, I'll assume that you are utilizing
    the whitelist to limit access to specific app users.</p>

         </span>
      </p>

      <p class="p">
         <span class="ph wysiwyg-font-size-medium">No. If you are the
    app creator, and you have access to the spreadsheet that the
    app is based on, you can distribute your app to other people
    who do not have direct access to that data. This works because
    the default execution mode ('as app creator'),
    instructs AppSheet to access data using the
    identity of the app creator. (Note: in certain advanced
    scenarios, you can specify the app to run as the app user.

    data? </strong>
         </span>
      </p>

      <p class="p">As the app creator, you have full control over what kinds of
    changes users can make to the data in your app, or
    whether they can make changes at all. You may want a
    unique combination of permissions: for example, you might want
    users to be able to add and update data, but not
    delete data. Or, you may want users to have the ability
    to add new data, but not update or delete data. Any
    combination is allowed. You can do this in both the
    Basic and Advanced Editors.</p>

      </p>

      <p class="p">
         <span class="ph wysiwyg-font-size-medium">Users of your app can
    only see data that you choose to expose through the app. In
    fact, you might want certain classes of users to only have
    access to view specific subsets of data, and other users to
    different data. <a class="xref" href="205113938-Defining-and-using-slices.html">You can do this
    using slices.</a>
         </span>
      </p>

      <p class="p">In the case of the Class Assignments app, I want to
    make sure that students can submit completed work and continue
    to view past submissions, but I don't want them to be able to
    see the completed work of other students. The best way to do
    this is to create a slice that shows only the assignments of
    the logged-in user. I'll do this from the Advanced
    Editor&gt;Data&gt;Slices tab, then clicking +Slice.</p>

      <p class="p">
         <img class="image" src="../appsheethelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/205041607/Screen_Shot_2016-01-22_at_5.25.30_PM.png" alt="">
      </p>

      <p class="p">First I'll need to name my slice and then specify a few
    parameters. In this case I'll want to choose the Submit
    table so new submissions will end up there. I'll also want to
    make sure students can only add submissions, and not delete or
    edit-- so I'll choose ADDS_ONLY as the update mode for
    the slice.</p>

      <p class="p">In order to make sure logged-in students can only see their
    own present and past submissions, I need to filter based on the
    Student column. Since I required sign-in for the app, my filter
    condition should be Matches user name-- the app
    will then only show data that matches the current logged-in
    user's name.</p>

      <p class="p">You'll see then, in the hamburger menu, that the current
    logged-in user's name shows up.</p>

      <p class="p">
         <img class="image" src="../appsheethelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/205041677/Screen_Shot_2016-01-22_at_5.26.37_PM.png" alt="">
      </p>

      <p class="p">You'll see below how the slice ensured Justin A. Sample
    would only be able to view his own past assignments.</p>

      <p class="p">

            <img class="image" src="../appsheethelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/203085568/assignments.jpg" alt="">

    Can I limit the actions or capabilities that specific users of
    the app can do?</strong>
         </span>
      </p>

      <p class="p">All users <em class="ph i">of the same app</em> will have the same
    editing, updating, or deleting capabilities. However, if
    you'd like different classes of users to have different
    permissions, the best approach is to create different
    apps for each user with the corresponding permissions levels.
    Each app would be tied to the same source spreadsheet. Creating
    a new app takes just a minute, especially if you start by
    copying an existing working app.</p>

      <p class="p">
         <span class="ph wysiwyg-font-size-large">
            <strong class="ph b"> </strong>

            <strong class="ph b">Who can access
    the data on the mobile device? </strong>
         </span>
      </p>

      <p class="p">On the mobile device, AppSheet uses industry-standard "local
    storage" technology associated with web browsers (web browser
    technology is embedded inside the AppSheet mobile app and the
    actual implementation largely utilizes HTML5 technology).
    Since you require users to sign in to access your app,
    each user's data is isolated from any other user's data. Even
    were multiple users to use your app from the same device, their
    data would be isolated as long as they sign into the device as
    different users. In short, if you follow standard security
    practices on the device (users sign in with passwords),
    your app will be as secure as all other apps based on web
    technologies.</p>

      <p class="p">
         <span class="ph wysiwyg-font-size-large">
            <strong class="ph b">What happens
    if an app user leaves my organization and I want them to stop
    using my
    app? </strong>
         </span>

      </p>

      <p class="p">At any time, you can return to the user whitelist and remove
    any users you've previously added. Any subsequent actions by
    the removed user from their mobile app will fail when the
    actions engage with the AppSheet cloud service (typically when
    synchronizing or saving data).</p>

      <p class="p">As an extreme measure, you could also make a copy of the app
    and delete the old one. The old one will stop working and then
    you can control access to the new one. You'll need to make
    sure to redistribute the new app link to the other users who
    still need access.</p>
