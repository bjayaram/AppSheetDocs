      <p class="p">Whenever you have address or lat/long geocoded data,
    AppSheet provides the ability to see it on a map. Columns of
    the Address or LatLong data types can be shown on maps. We
    utilize the Bing maps platform to handle addresses and
    mapping.</p>

      <p class="p">We rely on <strong class="ph b">Google Maps</strong> to provide driving
    directions. If you are using an iPhone or iPad device, you must
    install Google maps on that device to obtain driving
    directions.</p>

      <p class="p">Here are some other tips to make sure maps work well for
    you:</p>

      <ul class="ul">
      
         <li class="li">
        
            <strong class="ph b">If you use the LatLong data type</strong>
        
            <ul class="ul">
          
               <li class="li">the data values should be of the form "44.2456,
          -122.3348", i.e. comma-separated latitude and longitude
          values.</li>

          
               <li class="li">LatLong data can also be captured in a form field
          when editing entries or adding new entries. This uses
          high-accuracy GPS location capture on your device, which
          is potentially a time-consuming and battery-intensive
          operation. This function should therefore be used only in
          appropriate situations.</li>

        
            </ul>

      
         </li>

      
         <li class="li">
        
            <strong class="ph b">When using addresses</strong>
        
            <ul class="ul">
          
               <li class="li">try to provide complete addresses (including city and
          country). This may seem redundant. For example, a local
          business in one city may record addresses without a City,
          State, Country, and ZipCode. While this makes sense to
          the customer, Bing maps does not have the context to know
          to which city '100 Main Street' refers. Always try to
          provide as much information as possible.</li>

          
               <li class="li">if you find that your addresses are not being mapped
          correctly, try to look up the address at maps.bing.com to
          see if there is a problem with the way the address is
          written.</li>

        
            </ul>

      
         </li>

    
      </ul>

      <p class="p">Each of the entries in the table or slice being mapped is
    shown as a pin on the map. If you have many entries, this could
    lead to a messy map overrun with pins. Instead, AppSheet
    specifies a maximum number of pins to show, and chooses the
    closest pins around the current location. You can modify this
    maximum number for you app via the Advanced
    Editor&gt;UX&gt;Options tab.

      </p>

      <p class="p">You can interact with maps in the expected manner. Maps can
    be shown as road view or aerial view. The map view can be
    zoomed and panned as normal. By default, it starts zoomed out
    to a scale that can show all the pins. So, if you do have
    addresses to map in Australia as well as Canada, you will start
    with a map that is zoomed out to show half the world!</p>

      <p class="p">When you choose a specific item (or click/tap on a map pin),
    the map zooms in to the vicinity of that location. Some
    information about the highlighted item is shown at the top left
    of the view. This information typically includes a name (the
    contents of a column of type Name, or a key, or a Text column),
    an image if the data entry has an Image column, and a link to
    driving directions from the current location. This information
    can itself be clicked/tapped to see the full details of the
    entry.</p>
