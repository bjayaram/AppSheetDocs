   <div class="body">
      <p class="p">In this article, we'll explain:</p>

      <ul class="ul">
      
         <li class="li">what a key is</li>

      
         <li class="li">why it matters</li>

      
         <li class="li">how keys are chosen and how you can influence the
      choice</li>

      
         <li class="li">how keys are displayed in your app</li>

      
         <li class="li">why RowNumber is bad for a key</li>

      
         <li class="li">how to generate unique key values</li>

    
      </ul>

      <p class="p">The example of an auto repair shop will be used to expand on
    these topics.
    </p>

      <ul class="ul">
      
         <li class="li">
            <strong class="ph b">What is a key and why does it
      matter?</strong>
         </li>

    
      </ul>

      <p class="p">A key <strong class="ph b">uniquely</strong> identifies each individual
    row in the table. For example, for a product catalog, the
    Product ID or Product Name are good keys since each of those
    items will likely never repeat twice. Likewise, a First Name
    column wouldn't be a good key since first names are likely to
    repeat more than once.</p>

      <p class="p">The key may be a single column (such as Product ID) or a
    composite column (such as FirstName and LastName). Many data
    sets naturally have a key.
    </p>

      <ul class="ul">
      
         <li class="li">
            <strong class="ph b">How keys are chosen</strong>
         </li>

    
      </ul>

      <p class="p">When you create an app from your spreadsheet, AppSheet
    intuitively assigns a key by searching your data for columns
    without duplicate values. If AppSheet can't find a suitable
    key, it will combine two columns to create a Computed
    key. If it <em class="ph i">still</em> can't find a good key by
    combining two columns, row number will become the key; but row
    number as a key is generally not a good idea-- we'll talk
    more about that later in this section.</p>

      <p class="p">It's a good practice to make your intended key the
    leftmost column in your spreadsheet, if possible, since
    AppSheet reads the data from left to right. That being said,
    AppSheet will still scan the data and assign a key it thinks is
    best.</p>

      <p class="p">Let's say I work for an auto repair shop and I'm keeping
    track of our weekly services rendered and the total resulting
    profit. In my spreadsheet the <em class="ph i">type</em> of service is the
    leftmost column.</p>

      <p class="p">
         <span class="ph">
            <img class="image" src="../appsheethelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202856607/Screen_Shot_2015-08-21_at_11.48.01_AM.png" alt="">
         </span>
      </p>

      <p class="p">
         <strong class="ph b">
            <strong class="ph b"> </strong>
         </strong>
      </p>

      <ul class="ul">
      
         <li class="li">
            <strong class="ph b">How keys are displayed</strong>
         </li>

    
      </ul>

      <p class="p">Although Type is my leftmost column, once I generated a
    mobile app from the data (using the Google Sheets add-on)
    AppSheet chose Service as the key, because there is repeating
    data in the Type column and unique data in the Service column.
    AppSheet assumes the column with the key is the most important
    and therefore displays it first, <a class="xref" href="207340097-How-do-I-control-the-order-of-columns-displayed-in-the-app-.html">
    according to Rule 1 of how columns are displayed</a>.
    </p>

      <p class="p">
         <img class="image" src="../appsheethelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204818557/Screen_Shot_2016-01-08_at_4.50.38_PM.png" alt="">
      </p>

      <p class="p">
    You can always choose a different key than what AppSheet has
    initially designated. Do this in the Advanced
    Editor&gt;Data&gt;Column Structure tab.</p>

      <p class="p">In the case of the auto repair shop, it can be assumed that
    eventually the Service column will contain duplicates and
    therefore might not be a good key. To work around this,
    I assigned a unique ID number to each service I offer and
    created a corresponding column in the spreadsheet. (Since I
    added another column to my spreadsheet, I will need to
    regenerate the column structure in the Editor to see my changes
    show up). Now I can use the Editor to switch my key to the
    Service ID column.</p>

      <p class="p">Service ID is now the first column in my app-- and it makes
    a great key because each value in that column will never
    repeat, nor will it change over time.</p>

      <p class="p">If you choose as the key a column that already has duplicate
    values, AppSheet will give you a warning. For example, I've
    switched the key to Type-- since it has repeating values, I get
    the warning (seen on the <strong class="ph b">Info</strong> tab):
    </p>

      <p class="p">
         <img class="image" src="../appsheethelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204818587/Screen_Shot_2016-01-08_at_4.54.07_PM.png" alt="">
      </p>

      <p class="p">
    And if you try to submit an entry with data the key column
    already contains, AppSheet will give you a warning in the app
    and will not allow you to save the submission.
    </p>

      <p class="p">
         <img class="image" src="../appsheethelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204797698/Screen_Shot_2016-01-08_at_4.57.58_PM.png" alt="">

      <ul class="ul">
      
         <li class="li">
            <strong class="ph b">Why is RowNumber bad for a key?</strong>
         </li>

    
      </ul>

      <p class="p">As stated before, if AppSheet cannot find an appropriate key
    within your spreadsheet, it will default the key to row number.
    This isn't a good key however, because if entries are moved
    or deleted, or if users add or delete entries simultaneously,
    the row number for each row then changes and there is no way
    for AppSheet to uniquely identify the row. AppSheet will also
    give a warning if you choose row number as the key:
    </p>

      <p class="p">
         <img class="image" src="../appsheethelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204797708/Screen_Shot_2016-01-08_at_5.00.32_PM.png" alt="">

      <p class="p">
         <strong class="ph b"> </strong>
      </p>

      <ul class="ul">
      
         <li class="li">
            <strong class="ph b">How do I automatically assign unique key values
      to my data?</strong>
         </li>

    
      </ul>

      <p class="p">In some cases, you may need entries to automatically
    generate their own unique keys-- for example, in an app
    designed to capture product orders, each order must contain a
    unique order ID that cannot and should not be manually
    assigned. Our <a class="xref" href="https://www.appsheet.com/samples/An-app-for-a-salesperson-add-customers-orders-and-product-details?appGuidString=245700e5-9061-4045-843f-7850b5eb439a.html" target="_blank">
    Order Capture sample</a> shows you how to do this.</p>

      <p class="p">You'll see the app employs four different tables:
    Customers, Products, Order Details, and Orders.
    </p>

      <p class="p">

               <img class="image" src="../appsheethelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204797738/Screen_Shot_2016-01-08_at_5.10.31_PM.png" alt="">
    
    If you scroll through the table structures you'll see that
    each table has its own key. In the Orders table, Order
    Code has been made the key, but there's just one more
    step to ensure each Order ID will be unique. You'll need to
    scroll to the right and insert UNIQUEID() in the Default Value
    field.
    </p>

      <p class="p">

            <img class="image" src="../appsheethelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204797838/Screen_Shot_2016-01-08_at_5.26.38_PM.png" alt="">
         
      </p>

      <p class="p">
    
    Now, when I go back to the Orders view and add a new order, a
    unique order code has been automatically generated by
    AppSheet.
    </p>
