   <div class="body">
      <p class="p">
         <strong class="ph b">
            <span class="ph wysiwyg-font-size-large">There are a
    three ways you can include PDF's in your
    application. </span>
         </strong>
      </p>

      <p class="p">
         <strong class="ph b">1. Link to the PDF using a relative
    path</strong>
      </p>

      <p class="p">Using relative paths, you can create links to files relative
    to the spreadsheet that your app is using. This works in a
    similar way to links to image. For example, if the PDF is in
    the same directory as your spreadsheet, you can create a link
    to it just by putting in its name in your spreadsheet, eg.
    âÄòfoo.pdf'.</p>

      <p class="p">
         <strong class="ph b">2. Link to the PDF using a direct URL</strong>
      </p>

      <p class="p">Using direct Url's you can link to a pdf that is somewhere
    on the internet. Just like you would link to an image, you can
    link to a pdf, for example.
    âÄòhttp://www.mywebsite.com/path/super_pdf.pdf'</p>

      <p class="p">
         <strong class="ph b">3. Use a Google Drive URL</strong>
      </p>

      <p class="p">These are url's that you copy from your address bar in
    your browser when you are previewing a pdf in google drive, eg.
    âÄò<a class="xref" href="https://drive.google.com/view?id=1234.html" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/view?id=1234</a>'</p>

      <p class="p">Note that these are not direct or relative links, which
    means you are not supplying us with the actual PDF file. This
    means that you won't be able to take full advantage of
    AppSheet's PDF support.</p>

      <p class="p">
         <strong class="ph b">
            <span class="ph wysiwyg-font-size-large">How does it
    work?</span>
         </strong>
      </p>

      <p class="p">
         <strong class="ph b">iOS - </strong>Regardless of the type of URL,
    the pdf will be opened in Safari. However, only relative and
    direct URL's are guaranteed to be cached for offline use.</p>

      <p class="p">
         <strong class="ph b">Android -</strong> If you link to the PDF using a
    direct URL or relative path, the PDF will be downloaded to your
    phone, and you will be able to choose a viewer with which to
    view it. If you do not have a PDF viewer installed on your
    phone, we'll give you a link to the recommended viewer.</p>
