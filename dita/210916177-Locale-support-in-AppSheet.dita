   <title>Locale support in AppSheet â€“ AppSheet</title>
   <body>
      <p>
         <b>Locale vs Device Settings</b>
      </p>
      <p>
         <b>Data Locale</b>
      </p>
      <p>See the <b>Advanced Editor &gt; Data &gt; Tables
    &gt; Data
    Locale</b> setting.<b> </b>This
    setting is designed to align with the settings in your
    spreadsheet, so that AppSheet reads the information in your
    spreadsheet correctly and so that AppSheet returns data to your
    spreadsheet correctly. The focus is 1) parsing numbers
    correctly with commas and decimals for Field
    Types of <b>Decimal, Price,</b> and
    <b>Percent</b> and 2) reporting dates and times
    correctly for Field Types of <b>Date,
    DateTime,</b> and <b>Time.</b>  You may
    have one locale setting per spreadsheet and one Data Local
    setting per corresponding AppSheet table. </p>
      <p>Note: <b>Data Locale</b> does not impact
    <b>Price Currency</b> settings and AppSheet does not
    provide currency conversions. Data should be entered in your
    spreadsheet/app according to the currency you would like
    displayed. See <xref href="216120558-How-do-I-convert-from-US-Dollars-to-my-local-Currency-.dita">
    How do I convert from US Dollars to my local
    Currency</xref>. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
         <b>Locale for Google Sheets</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Google Sheets Locale setting controls how Date,
    DateTime, Decimal, Price, Percent, and Time values are entered
    into Google Sheets. For example, when the Locale is United
    States, United Kingdom or Japan, you must enter a period as the
    decimal separator between the whole and fractional parts of
    Decimal, Price, and Percent values. Conversely, when the Locale
    is Germany, France, or Brazil, you must enter a comma as the
    decimal separator.</p>
      <p>If your AppSheet application uses Google Sheets or Google
    Forms and specifies a Locale other than United States,
    you must specify the corresponding Locale in AppSheet. This is
    necessary because when AppSheet adds or updates a Date,
    DateTime, Decimal, Price, Percent, or Time value in a Google
    Sheet, it must use the appropriate data format based upon the
    Google Sheets Locale setting. Unfortunately, Google Sheets does
    not provide a way for AppSheet to retrieve the Google Sheets
    Locale setting automatically. Instead, we ask you to specify
    the Locale setting through the Advanced Editor.</p>
      <p>You can check the Locale assigned to your Google Sheet by
    clicking the Google Sheet File menu, selecting "Spreadsheet
    settings", and viewing the Locale setting. If the Locale is
    anything other than United States, you must specify a Locale in
    AppSheet.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
         <b>Configuring the Locale</b>
      </p>
      <p>1. Make certain that your Google Sheet specifies the
    appropriate locale. Do this by opening the Google Sheet. From
    the "File" menu select the "Spreadsheet settings". On the
    "Settings" dialog set "Locale" to your locale. For example, in
    Thailand select "Thailand".</p>
      <p>

         </image>
      </p>
      <p>2. Make certain that each Date, Time, DateTime, Number,
    Currency, and Percent value in the Google Sheet is
    formatted appropriately. Do this by selecting all of the cells
    in the column containing the data values. From the "Format"
    menu select "Number" and then the appropriate formatting style.
    For example, for date values select "Date", for currency values
    select "Currency", for time values select "Time", and so forth.
    Do the same for each Date, Time, DateTime, Number, Currency,
    and Percent column.</p>
      <p>3. Open your AppSheet app in the Advanced Editor and specify
    the locale for each table.</p>
      <ul>
      
         <li>Open your app.</li>
      
         <li>Go to the Advanced Editor&gt;Data&gt;Tables tab.</li>
      
         <li>Click the 'Edit this table definition' button to the left
      of each table name.</li>
      
         <li>In the Edit table definition dialog window, pick the
      appropriate Locale setting from the Locale dropdown. You
      should pick the Locale that most closely matches your Google
      Sheet Locale setting. For example, in Thailand select
      "Thai (Thailand)".</li>
      
         <li>Click the Save button at the bottom of the Edit table
      definition dialog window.</li>
      
         <li>Click the Save button at the top right of the Advanced
      Editor window.</li>
      
         <li>If your application includes multiple tables, repeat this
      for each of your tables.</li>
    
      </ul>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>4. Make certain that your browser or device is set to use
    your locale. For example, in Thailand select the Thai
    locale. All data is sent between the AppSheet client and the
    AppSheet server in a common universal format. The browser
    or device setting completely determines how data
    values are displayed on your browser or device.</p>
      <p>5. If you use a calendar other than the Gregorian
    calendar, make certain that your browser or device is set to
    use that calendar. For example, in Thailand select the
    "Buddist" calender. Many countries use the Gregorian calendar,
    so in many cases you can skip this step.</p>
      <p>6. Click the "Sync" button in the application to read
    the latest values from the Google Sheet. See if the Date,
    DateTime, Decimal, Price, Percent, and Time values are
    displayed correctly in the AppSheet application. If not,
    verify your browser or device locale settings.</p>
      <p>7. Try updating a Date, DateTime, Decimal, Price, Percent,
    or Time value and saving the changes to the server.
    See if the correct values appear in the Google Sheet and the
    AppSheet application.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
         <b>Compatibility Locale</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of the Locale values appearing in the Locale dropdown
    menu is the Compatibility Locale. This value is present for
    backward compatibility only. It preserves AppSheet's existing
    but limited Locale behavior. If you choose Compatibility
    Locale, we use a period as the decimal separator between the
    whole and fractional parts of Decimal, Price, and Percent
    values. We use simple rules for saving Date, DateTime, and Time
    values. We save formulas in the United States Locale format,
    which works for many Locales that use a period for the decimal
    separator. However, we recommend that you pick the specific
    AppSheet Locale that matches your Google Sheet Locale. If you
    Google Sheet does not specify a Locale, we recommend you
    specify AppSheet Locale United States.</p>
      <p>We currently support approximately 70 Locale values. We
    selected these locales based upon the Locales that Google
    Sheets currently supports. Please let us know if a Locale you
    need is missing from AppSheet.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
         <b>Locale for Excel</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is not necessary to set the AppSheet Locale for AppSheet
    applications that store data in Excel files on Box, Dropbox,
    Google Drive, Office365, or OneDrive. This is a consequence of
    the way we add and update data and formula values in Excel
    files. The AppSheet table Locale should be set to either United
    States or Compatibility.
    </p>
      <p>
         <b>Locale for Smartsheet</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is not necessary to set the AppSheet Locale for AppSheet
    applications that store data in Smartsheet. This is a
    consequence of the way we add and update data and formula
    values in Smartsheet. The AppSheet table Locale should be
    set to either United States or Compatibility.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
         <i>Note: Changing the Locale in AppSheet doesn't
    retroactively change the format of previous entries, nor does
    it necessarily reflect accordingly in the app emulator.
    What's displayed in the app emulator is based on the locale
    settings of your mobile phone or web browser. The Locale
    setting exists purely to affect the data that's pushed back
    to the spreadsheet.</i>
