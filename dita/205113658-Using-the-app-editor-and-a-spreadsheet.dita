   <title>Using the app editor and a spreadsheet â€“ AppSheet</title>
   <body>
      <p>AppSheet extracts tabular column structure from your
    spreadsheet, and works best when the spreadsheet has regular
    tabular data-- the first row has column headers and the
    remaining rows are data. Extraneous data, drawings, charts,
    etc. may cause problems. Here's how you understand and control
    the process.</p>
      <p>In the <b>Data</b> section of the Basic Editor,
    you see a few simple controls. The <b>Browse
    Data</b> link opens the spreadsheet in a separate
    browser tab. If you are using Google Sheets, this allows you to
    edit the Google sheet in one tab while you see the effects on
    your app in the AppSheet tab.

      <p> </p>
      <p>If you click on the <b>Preview Data</b> link, you
    see the first few rows of the spreadsheet conforming to the
    column structure that AppSheet has extracted. Each column has a
    header name and a data type. Also, one of the columns has been
    identified as the <xref href="205856197-Keys.dita">unique key</xref>.
    <xref href="208042838-How-should-I-choose-a-key-.dita">This
    choice</xref> is very important-- the unique key helps AppSheet
    synchronize changes made in the app back to the
    spreadsheet.

      <p>Every time you refresh the Basic Editor page, AppSheet
    checks your app and shows error, warning, and info messages at
    the top of the page. Wherever possible, AppSheet tries to
    automatically fix problems found and inform you.</p>
      <p>When you change the structure of the spreadsheet, AppSheet
    notices the difference between the spreadsheet and what it
    expects. So it gives you a warning: 'More columns than
    expected' or 'Less columns than expected'. If you are editing
    the app on our web page, it will try to automatically pick up
    the new structure. If the extracted column structure is not
    what you expect, or there are errors/warnings you want to act
    on, you would typically make changes to your spreadsheet (as
    described below) and then click <b>Regenerate Column
    Structure</b>.

      </p>
      <p>You can also choose to <b>switch to another
    spreadsheet</b>. There are two reasons to do this--
    perhaps you started with an example to play with and now you
    want to switch to a 'real' spreadsheet with a very different
    structure, or perhaps you want to switch to a different
    spreadsheet that has the identical structure (eg: switching
    from test data to production data). In both cases, AppSheet
    detects the new column structure and reacts appropriately to
    it.</p>
