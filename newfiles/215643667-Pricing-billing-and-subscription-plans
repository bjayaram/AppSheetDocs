    <p>AppSheet is a subscription service.</p>
<p>We have structured our plans and pricing to encourage adoption with minimal friction and barriers to use. If none of our plans are appropriate for your scenario, we encourage you to contact us.</p>
<p>By default, every user account is free until a specific subscription plan is chosen. Please review the list of available plans at our <a href="http://www.appsheet.com/home/pricing">Pricing page</a>.</p>
<p>You can modify your plan via the Billing tab on your account page.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Appropriate usage of each type of plan</strong></span></p>
<p>AppSheet is free only for prototyping and for personal projects. While you are evaluating AppSheet, you are not required to pay as you evaluate all of the platform features. In fact, we encourage you to try all the features of the platform. However, as you deploy your apps to others and start to use them in your organization, you should change your account to a paid plan. When you take your app through the 'Deploy Check' process, you will be warned if your account is not on a paid plan and that is the preferred stage at which to sign up for a paid plan. </p>
<p><strong>Per-user Plans</strong></p>
<p>When you build apps for users within your organization, you probably need to identify specific people who will use the app (perhaps members of your team or department). This is an ideal case for a per-user subscription plan. In a per-user plan, you purchase licenses for every user of your apps. Each licensed user can use many of your apps. So for example, if there are ten people in your team, you should purchase ten licenses and you can create one app, two apps, or any number of apps that are used by these users.</p>
<p><strong>Per-app plans</strong></p>
<p>If you build apps to send to a large base of occasional users (for example, for a community event, or to share your product catalog with your customers), a per-app subscription plan is probably appropriate. Per-app plans differ from per-user plans in that you cannot limit the app to specific users. They are meant for situations where data security is not a concern. In a per-app plan, you purchase licenses for each deployable app in your account. So for example, if you had two apps that you want to deploy widely, you would purchase two app licenses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Multiple plans within the same account</span></strong></p>
<p>Each AppSheet account has a single subscription plan. It is not possible to have some apps in an account associated with one plan and other apps associated with a different plan. We recognize though that this is a requirement for some of our customers and will release updates to accommodate such need. For now, you can create additional AppSheet accounts to add apps to a different type of plan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Changing plans and licenses</strong></span></p>
<p>You can change your subscription plan or the number of licenses on your plan at any time. Your charges are immediately applied and any charges are pro-rated to reflect the changes.</p>
<p>For example, assume you have five users of your app and have purchased five user licenses with a per-user plan. If you need to send the app to more users, you should simply increase the number of licenses via the Billing tab on your account page. Likewise, you can decrease the number of licenses to reflect lower expected usage or change plans.</p>
<p>It is uncommon to switch from a paid subscription plan to no plan unless you expect your apps to see absolutely no usage at all. It is usually more appropriate to modify the number of licenses to reflect periods of lower expected usage. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Enforcement of plans and licenses</strong></span></p>
<p>We try to ensure that app usage is never compromised because of short-term discrepancies in plans and licenses. If the actual number of users for your app crosses your license limits, we will still serve the app to those users. Likewise, if you are on the wrong plan or there is a problem with your credit card, we will continue to serve the app to your users. In both cases, we do this for a reasonable interval so that you have the time to modify your plan appropriately.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Billing</strong></span></p>
<p>You may choose and adjust your Subscription plan until you are confident that you have selected the correct plan for you or your business. Next, enter your Payment Method. Your credit card is charged on a monthly schedule based on the particular plan and license count you have chosen. AppSheet processes credit card payments through Stripe, a popular and reliable platform for credit card payments.</p>
<p>If you make changes in the middle of the month, the pricing is pro-rated to the time of the change. You may see adjustments to the next month's billing to reflect these changes. For example, if you lower the number of licenses, you will see credit reflected in your next month's bill. Please contact us at any time if you have questions about your billing. </p>
<p>As a paid subscriber, you get a monthly email with a summary of the last payment directly from Stripe, please use this receipt as your bill. Unfortunately we cannot produce individual invoices other than the emails sent to you directly from Stripe. Large Accounts may contact us directly for specific invoicing procedures.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Credit card failures</strong></span></p>
<p>When there is a failure processing a credit card payment, you will receive an email notification indicating that the credit card information should be updated. You can go to your account Billing page and update your card information. In the interim, your app status will remain active and the access to your app won't be affected for up to 15 days from the date the email notification was sent. </p>
<p>Our credit-card charges are USD-based, and cards based in countries outside the US may have security constraints that disable foreign charges. Unfortunately, we are unable at the moment to charge directly in currencies other than USD.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Receipts and invoices</strong></span></p>
<p>Every time your credit card is charged via Stripe, you will receive an invoice email from Stripe showing what you have been charged by AppSheet and the details of the invoice. If you have not received these invoice emails, please check your email folders in case the mail has been routed to a Promotions or Junk mail folder. If you still cannot find the invoice, we can manually retrieve the invoice for you.</p>
